 DataFinder: Scientific Dataset Recommendation from Natural Language Descriptions
 ## ABSTRACT
 Modern machine learning relies on datasets to develop and validate research ideas. Given the growth of publicly available data, finding the right dataset to use is increasingly difficult. Any research question imposes explicit and implicit constraints on how well a given dataset will enable researchers to answer this question, such as dataset size, modality, and domain. We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public.

SYNTHIAFigure 1  Queries for dataset recommendation impose
 constraints on the type of dataset desired. Keyword
 queries make these constraints explicit, while fullsentence
 queries impose implicit constraints. Ground
truth relevant datasets for this query are colored in blue.
With the growth of research in ML and artificial
intelligence (AI), there are hundreds of datasets
published every year (shown in Figure 2). Knowing
which to use for a given research idea can be difficult
 (Paullada et al., 2021). To illustrate, consider
a real query from a graduate student who says,  I
want to use adversarial learning to perform domain
adaptation for semantic segmentation of images.  
They have implicitly issued two requirements  they
need a dataset for semantic segmentation of images,
 and they want datasets that include diverse
visual domains. A researcher may intuitively select
popular, generic semantic segmentation datasets
like COCO (Lin et al., 2014) or ADE20K (Zhou
et al., 2019), but these are insufficient to cover the
query s requirement of supporting domain adaptation.
 How can we infer the intent of the researcher
and make appropriate recommendations 
To study this problem, we operationalize the
task of   dataset recommendation    given a fullsentence
 description orkeywords describing a research
 topic, recommend datasets to support research
 on this topic ( 2). A concrete example isarXiv 2305.16636v2  [cs.IR]  7 Jun 20231990 2000 2010 202005001,0001,50

Figure 2  The number of public AI datasets has exploded

shown in Figure 1. This task was introduced by
Färber and Leisinger (2021), who framed it as text
classification. In contrast, we naturally treat this
task as retrieval (Manning et al., 2005), where the
search collection is a set of datasets represented textually
 with dataset descriptions3, structured metadata,
 and published  citances    references from
published papers that use each dataset (Nakov et al.,
2004). This framework allows us to measure performance
 with rigorous ranking metrics such as
mean reciprocal rank (Radev et al., 2002).
To strengthen evaluation, we build a dataset, the
DataFinder Dataset , to measure how well we can
recommend datasets for a given description ( 3).
As a proxy for real-world queries for our dataset
recommendation engine, we construct queries from
paper abstracts to simulate researchers  historical
information needs. We then identify the datasets
used in a given paper, either through manual annotations
 (for our small test set) or using heuristic
matching (for our large training set). To our knowledge,
 this is the first expert-annotated corpus for
dataset recommendation, and we believe this can
serve as a challenging testbed for researchers interested
 in representing and searching complex data.
We evaluate three existing ranking algorithms
on our dataset and task formation, as a step towards
 solving this task  BM25 (Robertson and
Zaragoza, 2009), nearest neighbor retrieval, and
dense retrieval with neural bi-encoders (Karpukhin
et al., 2020). BM-25 is a standard baseline for text
search, nearest neighbor retrieval lets us measure
the degree to which this task requires generalization
 to new queries, and bi-encoders are among the
most effective search models used today (Zhong
et al., 2022). Compared with third-party keywordcentric

 relevant datasets. We show that finetuning the
3From www.paperswithcode.combi-encoder on our training set is crucial for good
performance. However, we observe that this model
is as effective when trained and tested on keyphrase
queries as on full-sentence queries, suggesting that
there is room for improvement in automatically
understanding full-sentence queries.
2 Dataset Recommendation Task
We establish a new task for automatically recommending
 relevant datasets given a description of
a data-driven system. Given a query qand a set
of datasets D, retrieve the most relevant subset
R Done could use to test the idea described in
q. Figure 1 illustrates this with a real query written
by a graduate student.
The query qcan take two forms  either a keyword
 query (the predominant interface for dataset
search today (Chapman et al., 2019)) or a fullsentence
 description. Textual descriptions offer a
more flexible input to the recommendation system,
with the ability to implicitly specify constraints
based on what a researcher wants to study, without
needing to carefully construct keywords a priori.
Evaluation Metrics Our task framing naturally
leads to evaluation by information retrieval metrics
 that estimate search relevance. In our experiments,
 we use four common metrics included in the
trec_eval package,4a standard evaluation tool
used in the IR community 
 Precision@ k  The proportion of relevant items
in top kretrieved datasets. If P@ kis 1, then
every retrieved document is valuable.

To support this task, we construct a dataset called
The DataFinder Dataset consisting of (q, R)pairs
extracted from published English-language scientific
 proceedings, where each qis either a fullsentence
 description or a keyword query. We
collect a large training set through an automated
method (for scalability), and we collect a smaller
test set using real users  annotations (for reliable
and realistic model evaluation). In both cases, our
data collection contains two primary steps  (1) collecting
 search queries qthat a user would use to
describe their dataset needs, and (2) identifying
relevant datasets Rthat match the query. Our
final training and test sets contain 17495 and 392
queries, respectively. Figure 3 summarizes our data
collection approach. We explain the details below
and provide further discussion of the limitations of
our dataset in the Limitations section. We will release
 our data under a permissive CC-BY License.

 of datasets listed on Papers With Code, a large

 of data. Many datasets also include the paper
that introduced the dataset. We used the dataset description,
 structured metadata, and the introducing
paper s title to textually represent each dataset, and
we analyze this design decision in  5.4.
3.2 Training Set Construction
To ensure scalability for the training set, we rely
on a large corpus of scientific papers, S2ORC (Lo
et al., 2020). We extract nearly 20,000 abstracts
from AI papers that use datasets. To overcome
the high cost of manually-annotating queries or
relevant datasets, we instead simulate annotations
with few-shot-learning and rule-based methods.
Query Collection We extract queries from paper
 abstracts because, intuitively, an abstract will
contain the most salient characteristics behind a
research idea or contribution. As a result, it is an
ideal source for comprehensively collecting potential
 implicit constraints as shown in Figure 1.
We simulate query collection with the 6.7B parameter
 version of Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022),
a large scientific language model that supports fewshot
 learning. In our prompt, we give the model an
abstract and ask it to first extract five keyphrases 
the tasks mentioned in paper, the task domain of
the paper (e.g., biomedical or aerial), the modality
 of data required, the language of data or labels
required, and the length of text required (sentencelevel,
 paragraph-level, or none mentioned). We
then ask Galactica to generate a full query containing
 any salient keyphrases. We perform few-shot
learning using 3 examples in the prompt to guide
the model. Our prompt is shown in Appendix A.
Relevant Datasets For our training set, relevant
datasets are automatically labeled using the body
text of a paper.5We apply a rule-based procedure
to identify the dataset used in a given paper (corresponding
 to an abstract whose query has been
auto-labeled). For

that satisfy two conditions  the paper must cite
the paper that introduces the dataset, and the paper
must mention the dataset by name twice.6

while the relevance judgements are obtained from the text
body, to encourage more general queries.
6We apply the additional requirement that the counted
dataset mentions must occur in a section with section title con-This tagging procedure is restrictive and emphasizes
 precision (i.e., an identified dataset is indeed
used in the paper) over recall (i.e., all the used
datasets are identified). Nonetheless, using this
procedure, we tag 17,495 papers from S2ORC with
at least one dataset from our collection of datasets.
To estimate the quality of these tagged labels, we
manually examined 200 tagged paper-dataset pairs.
Each pair was labeled as correct if the paper authors
 would have realistically had to download the
dataset in order to write the paper. 92.5% (185/200)
of dataset tags were deemed correct.
3.3 Test Set Construction
To accurately approximate how humans might
search for datasets, we employed AI researchers
and practitioners to annotate our test set. As
mentioned above, the dataset collection requires
both query collection andrelevant dataset collection.
 We use SciREX (Jain et al., 2020), a humanannotated
 set of 438 full-text papers from major
AI venues originally developed for research into
full-text information extraction, as the basis of our
test set. We choose this dataset because it naturally
supports our dataset collection described below.
Query Collection We collect search queries by
asking annotators to digest, extract, and rephrase
key information in research paper abstracts.

recruited 27 students, faculty, and recent alumni of
graduate programs in machine learning, computer

 ## ABSTRACT
 Modern machine learning relies on datasets to develop and validate research ideas. Given the growth of publicly available data, finding the right dataset to use is increasingly difficult. Any research question imposes explicit and implicit constraints on how well a given dataset will enable researchers to answer this question, such as dataset size, modality, and domain. We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public.

 ile some papers use
traditional datasets, most papers exclusively use
recently published datasets.
These patterns hint that researchers might overlook
 less cited datasets that match their needs in favor
 of standard status-quo datasets. This motivates
the need for nuanced dataset recommendation.
4 Experimental Setup on DataFinder
How do popular methods perform on our new task
and new dataset  How does our new paradigm
differ from existing commercial search engines  In
this section, we describe a set of standard methods
which we benchmark, and we consider which thirdparty
 search engines to use for comparison.
7We define  communities  by publication venues  ACL,
EMNLP ,NAACL ,TACL ,COLING for NLP, CVPR ,ICCV ,
WACV for Vision, IROS ,ICRA ,IJRR for Robotics, and
NeurIPS ,ICML ICLR for Machine Learning. We include
proceedings from associated workshops in each community.4.1 Task Framing
We formulate dataset recommendation as a ranking
 task. Given a query qand a search corpus of
datasets D, rank the datasets d Dbased on a
query-dataset similarity function sim(q, d)and return
 the top kdatasets. We compare three ways
of defining sim(q, d)  term-based retrieval, nearestneighbor
 retrieval, and neural retrieval.
4.2 Models to Benchmark
To retrieve datasets for a query, we find the nearest
datasets to that query in a vector space. We represent
 each query and dataset in a vector space using
three different approaches 
Term-Based Retrieval We evaluated a BM25
retriever for this task, since this is a standard baseline
 algorithm for information retrieval. We implement
 BM25 (Robertson and Walker, 1999) using
Pyserini (Lin et al., 2021).8
Nearest-Neighbor Retrieval To understand the
extent to which this task requires generalization to
new queries unseen at training time, we experiment
with direct k-nearest-neighbor retrieval against the
training set. For a new query, we identify the most
similar queries in the training set and return the relevant
 datasets from these training

other words, each dataset is represented by vectors
corresponding to all training set queries attached
to that dataset. In practice we investigate two types
of feature extractors  TF-IDF (Jones, 2004) and
SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019).
Neural Retrieval We implement a bi-encoder retriever
 using the Tevatron package.9In this framework,
 we encode each query and document into a
shared vector space and estimate similarity via the
inner product between query and document vectors.
 We represent each document with the BERT
embedding (Devlin et al., 2019) of its [CLS] token 
sim(q, d)  cls(BERT(q))Tcls(BERT(d))
where cls( )denotes the operation of accessing the
[CLS] token representation from the contextual
encoding (Gao et al., 2021). For retrieval, we separately
 encode all queries and documents and retrieve
 using efficient similarity search. Following
recent work (Karpukhin et al., 2020), we minimize
a contrastive loss and select hard negatives using

Dataset Search supports a large dataset collection,

Our test set annotators frequently entered multiple
 keyphrases for each keyphrase type (e.g.  question
 answering, recognizing textual entailment  for
the Task field). We constructed multiple queries
by taking the Cartesian product of each set of
keyphrases from each field, deduplicating tokens

each metric, we use bootstrap resampling (Koehn,
2004) over all test set queries. Term-based retrieval
(BM25) performs poorly in this setting, while the
neural bi-encoder model excels. This suggests our
task requires capturing semantic similarity beyond
what term matching can provide. Term-based kNN
search is not effective, implying that generalization
to new queries is necessary for this task.

the top 5 results before computing metrics.
We find these third-party search engines do not
effectively support full-sentence queries. We speculate
 these search engines are adapted from termbased
 web search engines. In contrast, our neural
retriever gives much better search results using both
keyword search and full-sentence query search.

this dataset representation in two ways. We first
add structured metadata about each dataset (e.g.
tasks, modality, number of papers that use each
dataset on PapersWithCode). We cumulatively experiment
 with adding citances   sentences from

dataset representation provides significant benefits
for keyword search. This suggests keyword search
requires more specific dataset metadata than fullsentence
 search does to be effective.
The value of finetuning Our bi-encoder retriever

required to construct a training set for tasks like
dataset recommendation, is this step necessary 
In Table 4, we see that an off-the-shelf SciBERT
encoder is ineffective. We observe that our queries,
which are abstract descriptions of the user s information

from any documents in the embedding space, making
 comparison difficult. Using a state-of-the-art
encoder, COCO-DR Base   which is trained for
general-purpose passage retrieval on MS MARCO
(Campos et al., 2016), helps with this issue but still
cannot make up for task-specific finetuning.

 DataFinder: Scientific Dataset Recommendation from Natural Language Descriptions
 ## ABSTRACT
 Modern machine learning relies on datasets to develop and validate research ideas. Given the growth of publicly available data, finding the right dataset to use is increasingly difficult. Any research question imposes explicit and implicit constraints on how well a given dataset will enable researchers to answer this question, such as dataset size, modality, and domain. We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public.

 es traditional search methods, including termbased
 keyword search and tag search (Lu et al.,
2012  Kunze and Auer, 2013  Sansone et al., 2017 
Chapman et al., 2019  Brickley et al., 2019  Lhoest
et al., 2021). In 2019, Google Research launched
Dataset Search (Brickley et al., 2019), offering
access to over 2 million public datasets. Our work
considers the subset of datasets from their search
corpus that have been posted on Papers with Code.
Some work has explored other forms of dataset
recommendation. Ben Ellefi et al. (2016) study
using  source datasets  as a search query, while
Altaf et al. (2019) use a set of related research
papers as the user s query. Färber and Leisinger
(2021) are the only prior work we are aware ofthat explores natural language queries for dataset
recommendation. They model this task as classification,
 while we operationalize it as open-domain
retrieval. Their dataset uses abstracts and citation
contexts to simulate queries, while we use realistic
short queries (with an expert-annotated test set).
We study the task of dataset recommendation from
natural language queries. Our dataset supports
search by either full-sentence or keyword queries,
but we find that neural search algorithms trained
for traditional keyword search are competitive with
the same architectures trained for our proposed fullsentence
 search. An exciting future direction will
be to make better use of natural language queries.
We release our datasets along with our ranking
systems to the public. We hope to spur the community
 to work on this task or on other tasks that can
leverage the summaries, keyphrases, and relevance
judgment annotations in our dataset.
The primary limitations concern the dataset we created,
 which serves as the foundation of our findings.
Our dataset suffers from four key limitations

 l queries in our test
set corresponded to datasets that are not in PwC,
such as IWSLT 2014 (Birch et al., 2014), PASCAL
VOC 2010 (Everingham et al., 2010), and CHiME4
 (Vincent et al., 2017). Papers With Code Datasets
also skews the publication year of papers used in
theDataFinder Dataset towards the present (the
median years of papers in our train and test set
are 2018 and 2017, respectively). For the most
part, PwC only includes datasets used by another
paper listed in Papers With Code, leading to the
systematic omission of datasets seldom used today.
Popular dataset bias in the test set Our test
set is derived from the SciREX corpus (Jain et al.,
2020). This corpus is biased towards popular or
influential works  the median number of citations
of a paper in SciREX is 129, compared to 19 for
any computer science paper in S2ORC. The queries
in our test set are therefore more likely to describe
mainstream ideas in popular subields of AI.
Automatic tagging Our training data is generated
 automatically using a list of canonical datasetnames from Papers With Code. This tagger mislabels
 papers where a dataset is used but never referred
 to by one of these canonical names (e.g. nonstandard
 abbreviations or capitalizations). Therefore,
 our training data is noisy and imperfect.
Queries in English only All queries in our
training and test datasets were in English. Therefore,
 these datasets only support the development
of dataset recommendation systems for Englishlanguage
 users. This is a serious limitation, as AI
research is increasingly done in languages other
English, such as Chinese (Chou, 2022).
Our work has the promise of improving the scientific
 method in artificial intelligence research, with
the particular potential of being useful for younger
researchers or students. We built our dataset and
search systems with the intention that others could
deploy and iterate on our dataset recommendation
 framework. However, we note that our initial

 ystems have the potential
to increase inequities in two ways.
First, as mentioned in Limitations, our dataset
does not support queries in languages other than
English, which may exacerbate inequities in dataset
access. We hope future researchers will consider
the construction of multilingual dataset search
queries as an area for future work.
Second, further study is required to understand
 how dataset recommendation systems affect
the tasks, domains, and datasets that researchers
choose to work on. Machine learning models are
liable to amplify biases in training data (Hall et al.,
2022), and inequities in which domains or tasks
receive research attention could have societal consequences.
 We ask researchers to consider these
implications when conducting work on our dataset.

 ## TITLE
 DataFinder: Scientific Dataset Recommendation from Natural Language Descriptions
 ## ABSTRACT
 Modern machine learning relies on datasets to develop and validate research ideas. Given the growth of publicly available data, finding the right dataset to use is increasingly difficult. Any research question imposes explicit and implicit constraints on how well a given dataset will enable researchers to answer this question, such as dataset size, modality, and domain. We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public.

 We introduce an attention-based sequence
learning model for the task and investigate the
effect of encoding sentence- vs. paragraph-level
information. In contrast to all previous work, our
model does not rely on hand-crafted rules or a
sophisticated NLP pipeline  it is instead trainable
end-to-end via sequence-to-sequence learning.
Automatic evaluation results show that our system
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art rulebased
 system. In human evaluations, questions
generated by our system are also rated as being
more natural (i.e., grammaticality, fluency) and
as more difficult to answer (in terms of syntactic
and lexical divergence from the original text and
reasoning needed to answer).

We present a self-supervised approach to estimate
flow in camera image and top-view grid map
sequences using fully convolutional neural
networks in the domain of automated driving. We
extend existing approaches for self-supervised
optical flow estimation by adding a regularizer
expressing motion consistency assuming a static
environment. However, as this assumption is
violated for other moving traffic participants we
also estimate a mask to scale this regularization.
Adding a regularization towards motion consistency
 improves convergence and flow estimation
accuracy. Furthermore, we scale the errors due to
spatial flow inconsistency by a mask that we derive
from the motion mask. This improves accuracy
in regions where the flow drastically changes
due to a better separation between static and
dynamic environment. We apply our approach
to optical flow estimation from camera image
sequences, validate on odometry estimation and
suggest a method to iter

In this paper, we study the actor-action semantic
segmentation problem, which requires joint
labeling of both actor and action categories in
video frames. One major challenge for this task is
that when an actor performs an action, different
body parts of the actor provide different types
of cues for the action category and may receive
inconsistent action labeling when they are labeled
independently. To address this issue, we propose an
end-to-end region-based actor-action segmentation
approach which relies on region masks from an
instance segmentation algorithm. Our main
novelty is to avoid labeling pixels in a region mask
independently - instead we assign a single action
label to these pixels to achieve consistent action
labeling. When a pixel belongs to multiple region
masks, max pooling is applied to resolve labeling
conflicts. Our approach uses a two-stream network
as the front-end (which learns features capturing
both appearance and motion information), and
uses two region-based segmentation networks
as the back-end (which takes the fused features
from the two-stream network as the input and
predicts actor-action labeling). Experiments
on the A2D dataset demonstrate that both the
region-based segmentation strategy and the fused
features from the two-str
