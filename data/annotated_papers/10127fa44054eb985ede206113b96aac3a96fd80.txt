Neural metrics for machine translation evaluation,
 such as C OMET , exhibit signiﬁcant
improvements in their correlation with human
 judgments compared to traditional metrics
 based on lexical overlap, such as B LEU.
Yet neural metrics are, to a great extent,
 black boxes  that return a single sentencelevel
 score without transparency about the
decision-making process. In this work,
we develop and compare several neural explainability
 methods and demonstrate their
effectiveness for interpreting state-of-the-art
ﬁne-tuned neural metrics. Our study reveals
 that these metrics leverage token-level
information that can be directly attributed
to translation errors, as assessed through
comparison of token-level neural saliency
maps with Multidimensional Quality Metrics
(MQM) annotations and with syntheticallygenerated
 critical translation errors. To

Reference-based neural metrics for machine translation
 evaluation are achieving evergrowing success,
 demonstrating superior results over traditional
lexical overlap-based metrics, such as BLEU (Papineni

in terms of both their correlation with human

 (Callison-Burch et al., 2006  Smith et al.,

increasingly large models (e.g., the winning metric

While some recent work has focus on explaining
the predictions made by reference-free quality estimation
 (QE) systems (Fomicheva et al., 2021 
Zerva et al., 2022), explaining reference-based
metrics has remained a largely overlooked problem
 (Leiter et al., 2022). It is an open question
whether the observations from studies of explainable

 weaknesses in the metrics. Our main contributions
 We provide a comparison between multiple explainability
 methods for different metrics on all
types of evaluation  src-only, ref-only, and
src ref joint evaluation.
 We ﬁnd that explanations are related to the underlying
 metric architecture, and that leveraging
reference information improves the explanations.
 We show that explanations for critical translation
errors can reveal weaknesses in the metrics.
2 Explaining Neural Metrics
We aim to explain sentence-level quality assessments
 of reference-based metrics by producing
token-level explanations that align to translation
errors. In what follows, we describe the metrics
and how we produce the explanations that we study.
We focus our analysis on two state-of-the-art
neural metrics  COMET (Rei et al., 2020) and
UNITE(Wan et al., 2022).1While both metrics
use a multilingual encoder model based on XLMR
 (Conneau et al., 2020), they employ distinct
strategies to obtain sentence-level quality scores.
On the one hand, COMET separately encodes the
source, translation and reference to obtain their respective
 sentence embeddings  these embeddings
are then combined to compute a quality score. On
the other, UNITEjointly encodes the sentences
to compute a contextualized representation that is
subsequently used to compute the quality score.
Interestingly, UNITEis trained to obtain quality
 scores for different input combinations  [mt 
src] (SRC),[mt  ref] (REF), and [mt  src 
ref] (SRC REF). In fact, when the input is SRC,

2.2 Explanations via Attribution Methods
In this work, we produce explanations using attribution
 methods that assign a scalar value to each
translation token (i.e. a token-level attribution) to
represent its importance. While many input attribution
 methods exist and have been extensively studied
 in the literature (Ribeiro et al., 2016  Shrikumar
et al., 2017  Sundararajan et al., 2017  Jain and
Wallace, 2019  Atanasova et al., 2020  Zaman and
Belinkov, 2022), we focus speciﬁcally on those
that have been demonstrated to be effective for
explaining the predictions of QE models (Treviso
et al., 2021  Fomicheva et al., 2022  Fernandes
et al., 2022  Zerva et al., 2022) and extend them to
our reference-based scenario. Concretely, we use
the following techniques to extract explanations 2

improvements over using only the source information.
 Moreover, while reference-based attributions
signiﬁcantly outperform source-based attributions,
combining the source and reference information to
obtain token-level attributions does not consistently
yield superior results over using the reference alone.
Notably, the best attribution method for COMET

The MQM data analyzed until now consists primarily
 of high quality translations, with the majority of
annotated errors being non-critical. However, it is
important to assess whether our explanations can
be accurately attributed to critical errors, as this
may reveal potential metric shortcomings. To this
end, we employ SMAUG (Alves et al., 2022)8, a
tool designed to generate synthetic data for stresstesting
 metrics, to create corrupted translations that
contain critical errors. Concretely, we generate
translations with the following pathologies  negation
 errors, hallucinations via insertions, named
entity errors, and errors in numbers.9
Explanations identify critical errors more easily
 than non-critical errors. Figure 2 shows that
explanations are more effective in identifying critical
 errors compared to other non-critical errors (see

dataset consists of 2610 translations. Full statistics about the
corrupted data and examples are shown in Appendix A.2.Table 1). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant performance
 improvements up to nearly 30% in Recall@K
 for certain critical errors. Overall, hallucinations
 are the easiest errors to identify across all
neural metrics. This suggests that neural metrics
appropriately identify and penalize hallucinated
translations, which aligns with the ﬁndings of Guerreiro
 et al. (2023). Moreover, explanations for
both UNITEmodels behave similarly for all errors
 except numbers, where the source information
plays a key role in improving the explanations. Notably,
 contrary to what we observed for data with
non-critical errors, COMET explanations are less
effective than those of UNITE REFandUNITE

 struggle to identify localized errors (negation
 errors, named entity errors and discrepancies
in numbers). We hypothesize that this behavior
is related to the underlying architecture. Unlike
UNITE-based metrics, COMET does not rely on
soft alignments via attention between the sentences
in the encoding process. This process may be key
to identify local misalignments during the encoding
 process. In fact, the attention-based attributions
forUNITEmetrics can more easily identify these
errors. COMET , however, encodes the sentences
separately, which may result in grammatical features
 (e.g. numbers) being encoded similarly across
sentences (Chi et al., 2020  Chang et al., 2022). As
such, explanations obtained via embedding alignments
 will not properly identify these misalignments
 on similar features. Importantly, these ﬁndings
 align with observations made in (Amrhein and
Sennrich, 2022  Raunak et al., 2022). This showcases
 how explanations can be used to diagnose
and reveal shortcomings of neural-based metri

5 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we investigated the use of explainability
 methods to better understand widely used
neural metrics for machine translation evaluation,
such as COMET andUNITE. Concretely, we analyzed
 how explanations are impacted by the reference
 information, and how they can be used to
reveal weaknesses of these metrics. Our analysis
shows that the quality of the explanations is tightly
related to the underlying metric architecture. Interestingly,
 we also provide evidence that neural
metrics like COMET may heavily rely on referenceinformation over source information. Additionally,
we show that explanations can be used to reveal
reference-based metrics weaknesses such as failing
 to severely penalize localized critical errors.
This opens up promising opportunities for future
research on leveraging explanations to diagnose
reference-based metrics errors. To support these
studies, we call for future datasets illustrating critical
 errors (e.g., challenge sets (Karpinska et al.,
2022)) to be accompanied by annotated error spans.
We highlight three main limitations of our work.
First, although we have explored gradient-based
explanations that take the whole network into consideration
 and have been shown to be faithful in
previous work (Bastings et al., 2021), we do not explicitly
 explore how COMET combines the sentence
representations in the feed-forward that precedes
the encoder model to produce the sentence-level
Second, we have shown that combining attention
 with gradient information results in the best
explanations for UNITE-based metrics. However,
from a practical standpoint, running inference and
extracting the explainability scores simultaneously
may be more computationally expensive than other
techniques  gradient-based metrics beneﬁt from
GPU infrastructure and require storing all gradient
Third, we have not explored extracting explanations
 in low-resource settings. That is because

In Section 2.1, we employed the latest publicly
available model ( wmt22-comet-da ) for COMET ,
which emerged as a top-performing metric in the
WMT 2022 Metrics task (Freitag et al., 2022). To
ensure a comparable setting for UNITE(Wan et al.,
2022), we trained our own model. In doing so, we
utilized the same data employed in the development
 of the COMET model by (Rei et al., 2022a),
without pretraining any synthetic data, as originally
 suggested. Additionally, our implementation
did not incorporate monotonic regional attention,
as our preliminary experiments revealed no discernible
 beneﬁts from its usage. The hyperparameters
 used are summarized in Table 3, while Table 4
presents the number of Direct Assessments utilized
during training. Furthermore, Table 5 displays the
segment-level correlations with WMT 2021 MQM
data for the News and TED domains.
Regarding computational infrastructure, a single
NVIDIA A10G GPU with 23GB memory was used.
The resulting UNITEmodel has 565M parameters
while C OMET has 581M parameters.
A.1 Output Distribution
To better understand the output of the models and
what scores are deemed low, we plotted the output
distributions for the two models we used in our
study. The average score for English  German
data is 0.856for the COMET model and 0.870for
theUNITEmodel we trained. From Figure 3 we
can observe the distribution of scores. This means
that the 0.6692 score from the example in Figure 1
corresponds to a low quali

 The Inside Story: Towards Better Understanding of Machine Translation Neural Evaluation Metrics
 ## ABSTRACT
 Neural metrics for machine translation evaluation, such as COMET, exhibit significant improvements in their correlation with human judgments, as compared to traditional metrics based on lexical overlap, such as BLEU. Yet, neural metrics are, to a great extent, “black boxes” returning a single sentence-level score without transparency about the decision-making process. In this work, we develop and compare several neural explainability methods and demonstrate their effectiveness for interpreting state-of-the-art fine-tuned neural metrics. Our study reveals that these metrics leverage token-level information that can be directly attributed to translation errors, as assessed through comparison of token-level neural saliency maps with Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) annotations and with synthetically-generated critical translation errors. To ease future research, we release our code at: https://github.com/Unbabel/COMET/tree/explainable-metrics

As we have seen in Section 4.2, we have created
 synthetic translation errors for the following
pathologies  negation errors, hallucinations via insertions,
 named entity errors, and errors in numbers.
Table 6 presents a summary of the examples created
using SMAUG and in Table 8 we show examples
of each error category.

From Table 1, it is evident that the alignments between
 the reference and/or source and the translation
 yield effective explanations for COMET . This
raises the question of how these alignments compare
 to the underlying encoder of COMET beforethe ﬁne-tuning process with human annotations. To
investigate this, we examine the results for XLM-R
without any ﬁne-tuning, as presented in Table 2.
Overall, the explanations derived from the alignments
 of COMET prove to be more predictive of
error spans than those obtained from XLM-R alignments.
 This suggests that during the ﬁne-tuning
phase, COMET models modify the underlying
XLM-R representations to achieve better alignment
with translation errors.
In Tables 9 and 10, we show examples of
COMET explanations for Chinese  English and
English German language pairs, respectively. We
highlight in gray the corresponding MQM annotation
 performed by an expert linguist and we sort the
examples from highest to lowest COMET scores.
From these examples we can observe the following 
 Highlights provided by COMET explanations
have a high recall with human annotations. In
all examples, subword tokens corresponding to
translation errors are highlighted in red but we
often see that not everything is incorrect.
 Explanations are consistent with scores. For
example, in the third example from Table 10,
the red highlights do not correspond to errors
and in fact the translation only has a major errorgriffen
 . Nonetheless, the score assigned by
COMET is a low score of 0.68which is faithful
to the explanations that was given even if the
assessment does not agree with
