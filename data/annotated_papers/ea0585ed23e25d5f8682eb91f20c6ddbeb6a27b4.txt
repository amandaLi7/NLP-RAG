 Towards Countering Essentialism through Social Bias Reasoning
 ## ABSTRACT
 Essentialist beliefs (i.e., believing that members of the same group are fundamentally alike) play a central role in social stereotypes and can lead to harm when left unchallenged. In our work, we conduct exploratory studies into the task of countering essentialist beliefs (e.g., ``liberals are stupid''). Drawing on prior work from psychology and NLP, we construct five types of counterstatements and conduct human studies on the effectiveness of these different strategies. Our studies also investigate the role in choosing a counterstatement of the level of explicitness with which an essentialist belief is conveyed. We find that statements that broaden the scope of a stereotype (e.g., to other groups, as in ``conservatives can also be stupid'') are the most popular countering strategy. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and open questions for future work in this area (e.g., improving factuality, studying community-specific variation) and we emphasize the importance of work at the intersection of NLP and psychology.

Essentialist beliefs (i.e., believing that members
 of the same group are fundamentally
alike) play a central role in social stereotypes
and can lead to harm when left unchallenged.
In our work, we conduct exploratory studies
into the task of countering essentialist beliefs
(e.g.,  liberals are stupid  ). Drawing on prior
work from psychology and NLP, we construct
ﬁve types of counterstatements and conduct
human studies on the effectiveness of these different
 strategies. Our studies also investigate
the role in choosing a counterstatement of the
level of explicitness with which an essentialist
 belief is conveyed. We ﬁnd that statements
that broaden the scope of a stereotype (e.g., to
other groups, as in  conservatives can also be
stupid  ) are the most popular countering strategy.
 We conclude with a discussion of challenges
 and open questions for future work in
this area (e.g., improving factuality, studying
community-speciﬁc variation) and we emphasize
 the importance of work at the intersection
of NLP and psychology.
Essentialism , i.e., the belief that members of the
same group are fundamentally alike, plays a crucial
 role in how prejudices and biases about social
and demographic groups are formed and expressed
(Leslie, 2014). For example, the statement   I speak
English, I don t speak libt*rd   implies the belief
that all   liberals are stupid .  If left unchallenged,
statements with such essentializing implications
can cause harm by perpetuating and reifying stereotypical
 beliefs about social groups (Greenwald and
Banaji, 1995  Steele, 2011  Prentice and Miller,
2007  Rhodes et al., 2012  Leshin et al., 2021).
In this work, we investigate the task of combating
 essentialist statements and beliefs through
psychologically and linguistically informed counterstatement
 generation. We examine these essentialist
 beliefs through the lens of generics (Rhodes

et al., 2012), i.e., beliefs that attribute a quality to a
target group without explicit quantiﬁcation ( liberals
 are stupid   Abelson and Kanouse, 1966  Carlson
 and Pelletier, 1995). In the context of toxic
or hateful language, these generic beliefs can be
both expressed directly or conveyed through subtle
implications (Gelman, 2003  Sap et al., 2020).
Automatically countering essentialism is challenging
 because it requires deep psychological reasoning
 about the linguistic implications of statements
   for example, changing people s beliefs
about stereotypes only through counterexamples
is difﬁcult (Kunda and Oleson, 1995). Therefore,
we examine ﬁve different strategies for combating
 essentializing stereotypes, combining insights
from psychology (Foster-Hanson et al., 2016, 2019 
Wodak et al., 2015) and NLP (Allaway et al., 2023).
We craft ﬁve types of statements (see Fig 1)  broadening
 the scope of a stereotype by generalizingarXiv 2303.16173v1  [cs.CL]  28 Mar 2023to  all people  or an alternative group ( LOTSand
ALT), providing direct counter-evidence through
speciﬁc individuals or groups ( DIR-INDandDIRGRP),
 and simply calling out the generalization
(TOL). In contrast to prior studies on countering
 hate-speech which use uncontrolled end-to-end
generation approaches (Qian et al., 2019  Zhu and
Bhat, 2021  Chung et al., 2020, e.g.,), we generate
 counterstatements by reasoning directly about
the targeted group, attributed quality, and linguistic
expression of a stereotype.
Since our work provides a preliminary exploration
 of this task, we conduct online studies in
three settings where counterstatements are paired
with human-written implications from the Social
Bias Frames Inference Corpus (SBIC) (Sap et al.,
2020). In these settings, we explore variation in
counterstatement effectiveness when the beliefs are
conveyed either implicitly, explicitly without context,
 or as an explicit inference from provided context.
 We ﬁnd that challenging a stereotype by applying
 it broadly (e.g., to  lots of people   LOTS
andALTS  Figure 1) is generally the most preferred
strategy. In contrast, statements containing direct
counter-evidence (e.g., DIR-INDandDIR-GRP 
Figure 1) are the least popular. Additionally, we
observe that the most favored strategy varies depending
 on whether the stereotype is explicitly presented
 to annotators (e.g., providing the essentialist
belief in Figure 1) or only conveyed implicitly (e.g.,
only providing the ﬁrst statement in Figure 1). For
example, direct counter-evidence is more popular
when the stereotype is explicitly provided. Our results
 highlight the complexity of countering essentialist
 beliefs and the importance of further investigation
 at the intersection of NLP and psychology.
2 Automatically Countering
We operationalize our counterstatement generation
 by focusing on the expression of stereotypes
through generics ( 2.1). Inspired by work in psychology
 and philosophy, we construct ﬁve types of
counterstatements to a stereotype ( 2.2).
2.1 Stereotypes as Generics
Many negative stereotypes are expressed as generics 
 they generalize a dangerous or harmful quality
(e.g., being a drunkard) to an entire group (e.g.,
Scots) based on the behavior of only a few individuals.
 Leslie (2008, 2017) termed such genericsstriking and argued that such generalizations are
based upon an assumption that all members of the
group in question (e.g., Scots) are disposed to possess
 the dangerous or harmful quality. We argue
that many stereotypes can also be interpreted as
asserting a quasi-unique association between the
group and quality. For example,  Scots are drunkards 
 also implies that Scots are distinctly more
likely than other groups (e.g., the English) to exhibit
 drunkenness. In our work, we assume that all
stereotypes under consideration are generics and
have both interpretations.
Since generics are unquantiﬁed, they naturally
allow for exceptions (i.e., counterexamples to

generic). While these exceptions may provide a
relevant source of counter-statements for a stereotype,
 some evidence from psychology suggests that
people are adept at maintaining their stereotyped
beliefs in the face of such speciﬁc exceptions (e.g.,
Kunda and Oleson, 1995). Therefore, we experiment
 with a variety of different counter-statements.
2.2 Generating Counter-Speech
To generate counter-speech to stereotypes, we produce
 ﬁve types of outputs in three broad categories
(see Table 1). Since the stereotypes we consider are
expressed as generics (e.g.,  Scots are drunkards ),
they can be separated into three components  a
group (e.g., Scots), a relation (e.g., are), and a quality(e.g.,
  drunkards ), which we use to construct
the counter-speech. Additionally, we prepend the
sentence  Actually, this is a generalization about
GROUP   to each type of statement we generate,
in order to contextualize the statements as counterspeech.
Direct Exceptions (D IR)Direct exceptions
present subgroups or individuals that do not have
the quality speciﬁed in the generic, and thereby
counter the striking or extrapolating implications
of the stereotype. For example, for  Scots are
drunkards , the extrapolating implication is that
 AllScots are drunkards   thus, direct exceptions
would be either individual Scots (e.g., Ewan McGregor1)
 or sub-groups of Scots (e.g., Scottish babies)
 who are not drunkards. We follow Allaway
et al. (2023) who propose that these exceptions can
be constructed with the following template

Table 1  Automatically generated counterstatements ( 2.2) from our system. The bottom two examples illustrate
challenges with factuality in the D IRcounterstatements.
We say that GROUP (x)is satisﬁed if xis either
a speciﬁc member of the group or a subgroup.
We generate subtypes (i.e., subgroups and speciﬁc
group members) using GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).
In particular, we prompt GPT-3 with a list of subtypes
 for an example group not in our data and
query the model to produce subtypes for GROUP as
the prompts completion. We choose as our example
group  men  (see Appendix A.1 for prompts). We
then construct exceptions following template DIR
using each generated subtype. In order to select
the most truthful and relevant subtypes, we apply
a truth discriminator from Allaway et al. (2023) to
each exception, and rank the subtypes by the probability
 of being true and relevant. We construct the
ﬁnal statements by combining the top three ranked
subgroups into a single exception (( DIR-GRP) in
Table 1) and combining the top three individuals
into a single exception ((D IR-IND) in Table 1).
Broadening Exceptions (A LTS)Broadening exceptions
 challenge the quasi-unique implication of
the generic by attributing the quality in question to
a different social group (e.g.,  Americans can alsobe drunkards ). Allaway et al. (2023) propose that
these exceptions follow the template 
 GROUP (x)  relation  QUALITY .(ALT)
where GROUP indicates a contextually relevant
alternative group. For example, if GROUP  
SCOTS , then a contextually relevant alternative
would be  GROUP  AMERICANS . In our work,
we deﬁne the relevant alternative group  GROUP
to be the perceived oppressing group. For example,
 if the generic is  women are vain , then  men 
would be the relevant alternative group  WOMEN
(i.e., the oppressing group). To avoid generating
stereotypes about the oppressing group, we convert
the relation into a hedged form (see Appendix A).
For example, if the relation is  are , the hedged
form of the relation would be  can be .
Broadening Universals (L OTS)In addition to
broadening exceptions, we generate broadening
universals , which maximize the scope of the quality
so that it includes people in general, rather than
any speciﬁc social group. That is, we generate5

the statements following template ALT, we also

Tolerance (T OL)Finally, we include the denouncing
 statement,  All groups of people deserve
tolerance , since denouncing is a common strategy
 in countering hate-speech (e.g., Mathew et al.,
2019  Qian et al., 2019  Ziegele et al., 2018). This
form of counter-speech does not depend on the details
 of the generic in question and so is the same
for all stereotypes. See (T OL) in Table 1.
As a preliminary investigation into the task of
generating counterstatements to combat essentialism,
 we use posts with gold-annotated implications

In order to investigate the effectiveness of different
counter statements ( 2), we conduct three different
human studies. In each study, we ask annotatorson Amazon Mechanical Turk to play the role of an
online content moderator or fact-checker whose job
is to provide counterstatements to expressed stereotypes.
 Each annotator is provided with a statement
and a set of machine-generated counterstatements
and asked to select their ﬁrst and second choices.
We also include an attention check to monitor annotation
 quality, and collect information on how
much annotators agree with the provided statement
and annotator demographic information. See full
instructions in Appendix B.
Our three human studies vary the statements provided

Note that for each pair (t, s)the counterstatements
are always derived from s, regardless of whether
annotators are provided sdirectly.
Our results show clear differences in how often
certain types of counterstatements are preferred
over others to combat essentialism (Figure 2). We
see that overall, the LOTScounterstatements are the
most popular for both ﬁrst and second choice. In
addition, when considering broadening statements

preference for such statements, compared to both

Of the generics-exceptions-based counterstatements,
 the direct exceptions DIRare consistently
the least preferred. We hypothesize that this is impacted
 by the high portion of incorrect statements
among the DIRtype (Figure 3), as well as the subjective
 nature of many stereotypes (e.g., in Table 1,1517

 only the statements notmarked as incorrect
by annotators, we do not observe a change in relative
 popularity. Therefore, future investigation is
needed to understand the role of correct individuals
in counterstatements.
In contrast, the broadening exceptions ALTrank
second as the second-choice and only 7% are
marked as incorrect. We also note that in settings
 where the stereotype is provided explicitly
(stereo and stereo post) the proportion of LOTS
was higher (and TOLlower) for the ﬁrst choice,
and for the second choice the proportion of ALT
increased markedly. From this we observe that the
effectiveness of a countering strategy may depend
on the explicitness of the demonstrated bias. For
example, generalizing the stereotype ( LOTS) may
be less effective when the stereotype is not explicitly
 identiﬁed (post setting).
Finally, we observe that when annotators agree
with a statement, their preference for LOTS statements
 increases while the preference for DIRcounterstatements
 decreases (Fig. 4a). Annotator preference
 for TOLalso decreases. We also note that
annotators more often endorse a belief when it
is stated explicitly, rather than implied by a text

both of directly identifying an essentialist belief
from an implication and of reasoning about the implications
 of the stereotype when countering realworld
 essentialist beliefs (i.e., from individuals who

and future directions ( 5.3).
5.1 Stereotypes and Psychology
Generic language, with its quasi-unique implications,
 readily conveys essentialist beliefs. Indeed,
psychological research shows that generic language
is a powerful mechanism by which social essentialist
 beliefs are transmitted between people, and even
across generations (Rhodes et al., 2012  Leshin
et al., 2021). Such implications can have a profound
 impact on children   e.g., girls as young as
6 years old have absorbed the stereotype that males
are more likely than females to be  really, really
smart  (Bian et al., 2017). In order to challenge
such essentialist beliefs, we argue that it is important
 to consider the complexities of generics and
associated inferences.
Through reasoning directly about the implications
 of generics, we construct counterstatements
that directly challenge essentialist implications. In
particular, our results highlight the value of broadening
 statements ( LOTSandALT), which counter
the implication that a particular negative quality
is distinctive of a particular group (e.g.,   Only
women are vain ). This ﬁnding is consistent with
recent work in psychology, in particular (FosterHanson
 et al., 2019). These statements thereby
challenge the cognitive value of the stereotype as an
information-processing short-cut (Devine, 1989),
since the wide applicability of the stereotyped qual-ity may result in many incorrect inferences (e.g.,
assuming someone is not vain because they are not
Furthermore, our results corroborate ﬁndings
from psychology that individuals who do not
ﬁt a stereotype are not viewed as invalidating
that stereotype, since they are categorized as special
 (e.g., Kunda and Oleson, 1995). In particular,
the consistently low preference for direct exception
statements comports with that ﬁnding ( DIR-IND
andDIR-GRP). Although providing facts (e.g., exceptional
 individuals) has been previously studied
as a strategy to counter hate-speech (e.g., Chung
et al., 2019  Mathew et al., 2019), our work speciﬁcally
 isolates the type of facts (i.e., direct counterevidence
 versus broadening statements) as a variable
 for investigation. As such, we can observe that
providing broadening facts is much more effective
than counter-evidence. This further highlights the
importance of reasoning about the speciﬁc implications
 of a text to counter essentialist b

 Essentialist beliefs (i.e., believing that members of the same group are fundamentally alike) play a central role in social stereotypes and can lead to harm when left unchallenged. In our work, we conduct exploratory studies into the task of countering essentialist beliefs (e.g., ``liberals are stupid''). Drawing on prior work from psychology and NLP, we construct five types of counterstatements and conduct human studies on the effectiveness of these different strategies. Our studies also investigate the role in choosing a counterstatement of the level of explicitness with which an essentialist belief is conveyed. We find that statements that broaden the scope of a stereotype (e.g., to other groups, as in ``conservatives can also be stupid'') are the most popular countering strategy. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and open questions for future work in this area (e.g., improving factuality, studying community-specific variation) and we emphasize the importance of work at the intersection of NLP and psychology.

5.2 Essentialism, Counter Hate-Speech, and
Although countering essentialism is similar in spirit
to countering hate-speech and content moderation,
common strategies in the latter are often inapplicable
 to countering essentialist beliefs. In content
moderation, discursive actions such as answering
clarifying questions or providing additional details
are common (Ziegele et al., 2018). However, since
essentialist beliefs are often conveyed implicitly
(e.g., see statements in Figure 1), discursive actions
aimed at a text may not actually address its essentialist
 implications. For example, the additional
detail  libt rd is not a real language  does not
actually counter the implication that liberals are
stupid in Fig 1. Similarly, while humor, expressing
afﬁliation with the targeted group (e.g.,  us Scots
only having a wee cuppa tea  ), and pointing out
hypocrisy or contradictions (e.g.,  it needs to involve
 food to be a meal  ) are common when countering
 hate-speech (Chung et al., 2019  Mathew
et al., 2019), they also do not address the essentialist
 beliefs implicit in a text (e.g., that Scots are
drunkards , Figure 1). As such, we argue that it is
important to investigate effective ways to counter
essentialist implications, as distinct from general
counter-speech and content moderation.

5.3 Limitations, Challenges, and Future
Along with promising preliminary ﬁndings, our results
 highlighted several limitations and challenges
that should be tackled in future work.
Human-annotated implications Since this
work constitutes preliminary investigation on
the promise of using NLP tools for combating
essentialism, we used a corpus of statements
paired with gold human-annotated implications.
However, such annotations will not always be
available. Future work should examine whether
our ﬁndings would hold with machine-generated
implications (e.g., using the neural model from Sap
et al., 2020), on various types of source domains
and overtness levels (e.g., the corpus of implicit
toxicity from Hartvigsen et al., 2022). Furthermore,
future research could investigate how the quality
and speciﬁcity of the implications affects the
counterstatement generation and effectiveness.
Targeted group and annotator identity Our
studies are conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk
which can be lacking in diversity among annotators.
 For example, the majority of annotators in
our study were white (Fig 5a) or male (Fig 5b).
In contrast, targeted groups are often notwhite or
male (see Table 2). Since an annotator s identity
and beliefs may impact their perceptions of how
effective a counterstatement is (as they do with perceptions
 of toxicity  Sap et al., 2022), homogeneity
in the annotator population limits our results. Additionally,
 how deeply rooted an essentialist belief is
for an annotator may impact what they consider ef-Group Nb Examples

fective counterstatements. Our results, which show
large variation in annotator preference depending
on whether they endorse a statement, corroborate
these ﬁndings. Therefore, future work should investigate
 more diverse annotator pools or matching
annotators to targeted groups, as well as examining
how annotator s familiarity with essentialist beliefs
and identities affect their judgements.
Furthermore, prior work in countering hatespeech
 has show that effective strategies can vary
widely depending on the target group (Mathew
et al., 2019  Chung et al., 2019). In our work,
we consider results aggregated across all groups.
However, community-speciﬁc investigations are an
important future step towards developing effective
Accuracy of generated exceptions The selection
 of speciﬁc individuals for direct exceptions
presents an ongoing challenge, based on the high
number of DIR-INDmarked incorrect. Since language
 models often encode biases and stereotypes
derived from training corpora (Sheng et al., 2019),
they may have difﬁculty producing relevant individuals
 who are not prototypical (i.e., they do not have
a particular stereotype). We illustrate incorrect individuals
 and subgroups in the bottom two examplesof Table 1. Additionally, as mentioned in  4, many
stereotypes are subjective (e.g.,  women are vain ).
Therefore, individuals who are counterexamples to
the stereotype may be judged differently by different
 people (e.g., our system proposes that  taylor
swift, sarah palin, and scarlett johansson  are not
vain). Producing accurate and relevant direct exceptions
 to a stereotype is important for understanding
the role of such examples to counter essentialist
Our results and discussion highlight the complexity
 of countering essentialist beliefs. We propose
that future work should improve the factuality of
counterstatements, particularly of direct counterevidence,
 and consider both variation in respondent
 demographics and community-speciﬁc needs.
Therefore, we argue that working at the intersection
 of NLP and psychology is crucial for further
investigations in this area.
6 Societal and Ethical Considerations
Annotation Considerations Prior work has
highlighted the potential harms to workers who are
subjected to offensive statements (Roberts, 2017 
Steiger et al., 2021). To mitigate these, we encourage
 annotators to reach out to the authors with
concerns and questions or to the Crisis Text Line.2
Additionally, our study design was approved by
our ethics review board (IRB) and workers earned
a median wage of $10/h.
Risks of Generation Since our system automatically
 generates counterstatements, there is potential
 for misuse in several ways. First, our system
can automatically and quickly produce millions
of counterstatements could therefore be used in
a distributed-denial-of-service attack. Second, by
generating counterstatements to stereotypes in text
the original text remains available and so it may
still cause harm (Ullmann and Tomalin, 2019) and
perpetuate essentialist beliefs. Additionally, the automatic
 construction of counterstatements has the
potential to produce false statements and further
harmful generalizations (e.g., generalize a harmful
stereotype to another marginalized group). Considering
 these factors, it is important to jointly develop
regulation alongside AI technology to limit harms
and misuse in deployment (Crawford, 2021  Reich

Amazon Mechanical Turk who were qualiﬁed for a

Figure 7. Before choosing the most convincing
counter statements, annotators have the option to
mark each statement as incorrect or ungrammatical
(Figure 7b). Note that before asking annotators to
select their second choice, we include an attention
check (in Figure 7c). The attention check was randomly
 set in each HIT. Annotations where the attention
 check incorrect were discarded. As a result,
we removed 3 annotations from the post setting, 5
from the stereo setting, and 4 from post stereo .
For each annotation, we also collected demographic
 information (Figure 8). The demographic
 information is associated only with an annonymized
