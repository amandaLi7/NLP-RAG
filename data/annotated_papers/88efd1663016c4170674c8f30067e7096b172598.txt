 ## ABSTRACT
 Apple and Android introduced privacy labels in 2020 and 2022 respectively as a way of providing consumers with succinct summaries of mobile apps’ more salient data practices. A number of apps are published in both stores, offering us the opportunity to compare their privacy label disclosures in the two app stores. This paper compares the data practices privacy labels are intended to capture in each store. It then proceeds to analyze the disclosures of 822 apps published in both app stores, focusing on possible discrepancies. This analysis reveals that privacy label disclosures of what is ostensibly the same mobile app can be quite different. We discuss the different possible reasons behind these differences, including the possibility that these discrepancies might be indicative of potential privacy compliance issues. In particular, focusing on data collection disclosures of five different data types (location, contact info, sensitive info, identifiers, and health & fitness) we find discrepancies between iOS and Google Play privacy label disclosures in 66.5% of the mobile apps we analyze.

 h information about the data collected
and shared by apps and the way the data is protected [13].
These labels are designed with the aim of helping users
make informed decisions before installing applications
based on their privacy practices.
Apple, one of the leading participants in the mobile
operating system industry, has a privacy label section
built into the App Store. The iOS privacy labels, which
went into effect in December 2020, ask app developers
to provide explicit breakdowns into the various types of
data they gather, including contact information, location
data, and browser history. In a similar manner, Android
introduced its own privacy labels into the data safety
section on the Google Play Store in April 2022.
Privacy labels in both ecosystems must be declared by
app developers, which invite users to rely on the veracityof their statements. Nevertheless, app developers may intentionally
 or unintentionally be omitting information. Our
study attempts to shed light on this issue by presenting a
comparison between Android and iOS privacy labels. The
contributions of this work are as follows

the privacy labels comparison is presented. An analysis
at scale is conducted in Section 4, highlighting the differences
 identified. Those differences are discussed in section
5 with the relevant findings. Potential threats to validity
are exposed in Section 6 and the paper s final conclusions
are reported in Section 7.
2. Background & Related Work
Privacy labels have emerged as a result of the readability
 and comprehension problems of privacy policies
[5], [25], [26]. Their scope is to encourage developers to
disclose their applications  privacy practices following a
template that allows a better understanding by users. This
section will define the particularities of iOS and Android
privacy labels. Then, we propose a mapping between the
correspondent practices and data types in both ecosystems.
Finally, the closest related work is presented highlighting
the differences with our contributions.2.1. iOS Privacy Labels
Since the addition of Apple s privacy labels in December
 2020 [20], developers have been asked to describe
four privacy aspects of their apps (see Figure 1, bottom) 
data item, data type, data purpose, and data practice. The
data item is the specific data to be collected by the app,
which belongs to a higher data type (i.e., category), for
example, the  name  data item belongs to the  contact
info  data type. The purpose is the app s reason for
accessing these data e.g. analytics or app functionality.
Data practice describes to what extent the piece of data
will be linked to the user identity i.e Data not Linked
to You, Data Linked to You, and Data used to Track
You. Data not Linked to You refers to de-identified or
anonymized data. Data Linked to You refers to data linked
to the user s identity e.g via their account, device, or other
details. Data used to Track You refers to further linking the
data with new third-party data for advertising purposes,

 ring it with a data broker. It s worth noting that in
Apple parlance, data collection implies   sending the data
off-device in a way that allows developers or third-parties
to access it for a period longer than what is necessary to
service the transmitted request in real time   [4].
iOS app developers are encouraged to declare the type
of data to which each practice alludes, as well as the
category in which the data may fall and the purpose for
accessing it. Data items, data categories, and purposes are
declared in the privacy labels from among those provided
2.2. Android Privacy Labels
Android privacy labels went into effect in April 2022,
following a similar overall format for data item and data
types, but with some remarkable differences in purposes
and practices, when compared to iOS labels. Android
practices distinguish between data collection and data
sharing. Android data collection refers to the same concept
as iOS but, interestingly, according to Android terms, a
piece of data does not need to be disclosed as  collected 
when it is sent off-device over an encrypted connection.
Data sharing refers to a broader concept than iOS
Data Used to Track, where  Sharing  refers to transferring
user data to a third party. This practice might not be
necessarily disclosed in the labels if the data is previously
anonymized. As can be seen in Figure 1 (left), data categories,
 data types, and purposes follow a similar disclosing
format compared to iOS [6].
2.3. Privacy Labels mapping
The mapping between iOS and Android labels is
not straightforward. By comparing data practices, data
items, and purposes we could observe many-to-many relationships
 between iOS and Android labels. An example
of the intricacies of the relationship between labels is
shown in Figure 2, where iOS Developer s Advertising or
Marketing purpose is mapped to Android Advertising or
marketing and Developer communications purposes, while
iOS Third-Party Advertising is also mapped to Android

The many-to-many relationship between the platforms 
 labels hinders making a straightforward comparison
 between all iOS and Android data labels. We have
therefore limited our comparison to exclusively identical
practices and data (i.e., one-to-one relationships). Data
Used to Track in iOS alludes to the specific purpose of
tracking, which is a subset of possible uses given to data
shared in Android. The great difference between these two
labels made us limit our comparison to data collection

sharing of personal data by organizations in an easy-tounderstand
 format. However, the use of privacy labels forTABLE 1. M APPING BETWEEN I OS AND ANDROID PRIVACY LABELS

 concluded that   Apple s privacy labels still do not

 privacy practices  .
Other related works have analyzed the content of iOS
privacy labels [11], [13], [18], and assessed their trustworthiness
 [9], [24]. In particular, Xiao et al. [24] conducted
the first comparison between apps  privacy labels and
their actual behavior by conducting a dynamic analysis on
5,102 iOS apps, reporting inconsistencies in 3,423 privacy
labels. A study of a similar nature was conducted by Koch
et al. [9], analyzing 1,687 iOS apps for privacy labels 
correctness. During their analysis, they could observe that
 At least 276 [...] apps violate their privacy label by
transmitting data without declaration, showing that the
privacy labels  correctness was not validated during the
app approval process  .
But even fewer studies [3], [19] have addressed Android
 privacy labels. Closer to our work, Mozilla has
conducted a study [19] on the Android top 20 free apps
and top 20 paid apps comparing the privacy policy with
the privacy labels for each app. The study concludes by
finding discrepancies between privacy policies and privacy
labels for nearly 80% of the apps reviewed.
Likewise, a reduced number of studies have addressed
the comparison between iOS and Android from a privacyperspective [2], [10], [12]. For example, Kollnig et al. [10]
used static and dynamic analysis techniques to assess iOS
and Android applications identifying personal data leaks.
During this comprehensive work, they also analyzed the
recipient s identity and location to uncover compliance
The related works described above have either focused
on analyzing privacy labels in a single ecosystem or have
compared apps  privacy behavior in both domains. To the
best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed a
comparison between iOS and Android privacy labels.

We begin by detailing the iOS and Android apps  selection
process in Section 3.1. Afterward, in Section 3.2, we
provide details on how we collected the iOS and Android
privacy labels. Finally, in Section 3.3, we describe the
method to perform a static analysis on the apps and check
whether the privacy labels match with actual apps  code.
3.1. iOS and Android apps selection
Conducting a comparison between the privacy labels
of App Store and Google Play Store applications requires
a dataset containing matching applications from both markets.
 To create a dataset of this kind we pursued the
iOS apps selection. We scraped the App Store website
to collect the name and other details (e.g., privacy policy
URL) of the whole list of available applications. From the
list, we randomly selected a subset to conduct this study.
Finding matches in Google Play Store. We created
an automated method to find the Android app matching
each iOS app in our dataset. The method follows a twophase
 pipeline  1) looking for the iOS app name in the
Play Store apps  search bar, and 2) comparing both apps 
information to determine if they are actually the same app.
The first phase was a straightforward process where
we selected the first result (i.e., potentially the most similar
 according to Play Store). In order to perform the second
 phase, we first evaluated several approaches on which
we based our comparison  application name, developer
name, website URL, privacy policy URL, and app s logo.
Our evaluation determined that the logo comparison is the
most reliable approach to determining if two applications
are indeed the same on both platforms.
The logo comparison method downloads both logos
and then performs a comparison based on the Structural
Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) [23] between them. Our
initial validation in a random sample of 30 applications
outputted a 1.0 precision score when using an SSIM
threshold of 0.9 in the range of [0-1]. However, we found
a few false positiv

Apps filtering. Since we needed to ensure that the
dataset contained only matching applications for the labels
comparison, we conducted an additional step to discard
potentially incorrectly tagged apps. This filtering consisted
in comparing the privacy policies of both apps available
on their corresponding platforms.
Before comparing the privacy policies, we required
collecting and ensuring they are indeed privacy policies.We employed Selenium to retrieve those policies loaded
through dynamic code. Likewise, it was necessary to
discard those URLs leading to non-privacy policies  websites
 (e.g., landing pages). To do so, we used a machine
learning-based classifier that allows us to differentiate
between privacy policies and other texts. This classifier
is based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm
 and was trained with 195 manually classified texts,
achieving 98.76% precision, 97.56% recall, and 98.15%
F1 score when evaluated against 100 unseen English texts.
After discarding non-privacy policies texts, we compared
them by computing the cosine similarity [21] to dismiss
the applications that did not perfectly match (i.e., cosine
similarity of 1.0) based on the similarity between privacy

iOS labels collection. We iterated the process of
scraping the privacy labels for each iOS application. The
iOS privacy labels are dynamically loaded in a pop-up
window after clicking on a  See details  button. This
mandatory interaction requires the use of Selenium to
trigger the button and load the HTML. Afterward, the
BeautifulSoup python library [16] parses the HTML code
and we iterate the collection of practices, types of personal

not reuse the same web resource for the privacy labels

we can collect the practices, types of personal data, and
purposes in a shorter period of time than for iOS apps.
Labels comparison. As we explained in Section 2, we
have two types of practices in iOS and Android privacy
labels. The Android  data collected  practice could be
directly compared with the  Data Linked to You  and
 Data Not Linked to You  in iOS, while the data shared in
Android cannot be compared with the  Data Used to Track
You  due to the different meaning explained in Section
2. Therefore, we limit the comparison of privacy labels
to data collected usage. Along the process two different
topics will be compared  1) the aggregated personal data
types in each ecosystem and 2) the data collected by the
same apps (i.e., Android app and iOS app).
3.3. Comparing Android privacy labels to actual
The popularity of third-party libraries has grown to
the point that it has surpassed the amount of developers 
 source code [22]. In some cases, developers can be
unaware of the whole behavior of these libraries, which
could lead them to incorrectly select their app s privacy
labels. Sometimes developers simply do not know or understand
 in detail how their application behaves in terms of
privacy. We also aim to look at the code of Android apps
and compare our analysis of the code with disclosures
provided in privacy labels.
To do so, we relied on the following pipeline to
perform static app analysis. First, we use an unofficialAPI [1] to download the Android applications. Afterward,
we decompile and re-build the java code of the apk file
with jadx [17], obtaining the Manifest file along with the
application s smali and java code.
Once the application s source code is built, we check
the permissions in the manifest file to see whether the
app is requesting access to personal data. Additionally,
we automatically inspect all java files looking for the API
calls that access the personal

 Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores
 ## ABSTRACT
 Apple and Android introduced privacy labels in 2020 and 2022 respectively as a way of providing consumers with succinct summaries of mobile apps’ more salient data practices. A number of apps are published in both stores, offering us the opportunity to compare their privacy label disclosures in the two app stores. This paper compares the data practices privacy labels are intended to capture in each store. It then proceeds to analyze the disclosures of 822 apps published in both app stores, focusing on possible discrepancies. This analysis reveals that privacy label disclosures of what is ostensibly the same mobile app can be quite different. We discuss the different possible reasons behind these differences, including the possibility that these discrepancies might be indicative of potential privacy compliance issues. In particular, focusing on data collection disclosures of five different data types (location, contact info, sensitive info, identifiers, and health & fitness) we find discrepancies between iOS and Google Play privacy label disclosures in 66.5% of the mobile apps we analyze.

  data. We use this information
to perform the comparison with the app privacy labels
looking for dissimilarities.
4. Evaluation in the wild
This section describes the evaluation conducted to
compare Android and iOS privacy labels following the
method described in Section 3.
To collect the dataset of apps and privacy labels we
started by looking for details on 35k randomly selected
apps in the App Store. While scraping the website to get
the name and information for each app, we simultaneously
searched for the matching Android application. After this
process, we found almost 11k matching candidate pairs
of iOS and Android apps. We further analyzed each
pair by applying the methods described in Section 3.1,
successfully identifying 1,423 exact matches.
Out of these 1,423 exact matches, 1,106 of the iOS
apps have privacy labels, while only 911 Android apps
do. The intersection set yields 822 apps, namely apps
that have published labels in both app stores. Our analysis
focuses on these 822 apps.
Figure 3 shows the overall number of Android (green)
and iOS applications (blue) claiming to collect each data
type. As can be seen, there are mismatches in the privacy
labels for some data types. For example, precise and
approximate location have a difference of 54% in favor
of iOS and 36% in favor of Android respectively for each
of these data types. This suggests that when collecting
location data, iOS apps tend to favor precise location and
Android apps favor approximate location.
Another significant mismatch can be seen between
user and device identifiers. 43% more iOS apps disclose
collecting user identifiers, while 30% more Android apps
claim to collect device identifiers. However, the most
alarming gap is between the number of apps claiming to
collect sensitive information. According to Apple, sensitive
 information refers to racial or ethnic data, sexual orientation,
 disability, and religious or philosophical beliefs,
among others. Although we can observe a low number

apps reporting the collection of this data type, we would
expect to see exactly the same number of apps on both
platforms due to its sensitivity. Interestingly too, almost
twice as many iOS apps declare to collect user health
data, considered by privacy regulations (i.e., GDPR) as
Nevertheless, the most compelling comparison that
can be done between Android and iOS in relation to
privacy labels is to determine whether the same types of
personal data are claimed to be collected for the same
application (in both ecosystems). This is shown in Figure
4, where we report the number of Android apps that disclose
 the collection of a given data type 1) only in Android
(green), 2) only in iOS (blue), 3) in both (yellow). TheFigure 3. Comparison between the number of Android (green) and iOS (blue) apps declaring the collection of each data type
remaining applications up to the 822 analyzed correspond
to those that do not declare the collection of the data in
any marketplace. Again, a remarkable gap between Precise
location, Coarse location, User ID, and Device ID can
be observed Surprisingly, we can observe that only seven
applications match reporting the collection of sensitive
information, while 16 differ.
The comparison of privacy labels is limited to what
developers report their applications to do. However, apps
may intentionally or unintentionally be accessing nonreported
 personal data. To assess their statements, we
managed to successfully download and perform static
analysis on 560 out of the 822 Android apps.
First, we checked whether applications have access to
two types of personal data  coarse location and precise location.
 Figure 5 shows a comparison between the apps that
request access to these data and whether their collection is
declared in the privacy labels. As can be seen, 36.6% and
38.2% of the apps that do not declare collecting coarse
and precise location respectively, request permissions to

 ali code for the 560 applications. As described in
Section 3.3, we have looked for the API calls that retrieve
the precise and coarse location, observing that for the 54
apps found accessing these two data types, none of them
disclose their collection in the privacy labels. Although
not conclusive due to static analysis limitations [15] our
findings suggest a mismatch between what labels disclose
and what apps may actually be doing.5. Discussion
Asubstantial 66.5% of the 822 applications analyzed
show potential discrepancies between iOS and Android
privacy labels . Moreover, out of the 503 that claim to
collect personal data in both marketplaces, only 16 (3.2%)
agree on all the data types mapped in Section 2.
These results suggest notable differences in data practice
disclosure in the iOS and Google Play app stores for apps
that one would otherwise have expected to have identical
or nearly identical data practice disclosures.
There are two major possible explanations for our
observations  1) apps indeed behave differently in each
ecosystem and the privacy labels are correct and consistent
with that, or 2) the difference suggests apparent inconsistencies
 of the data practice disclosures of the privacy
labels. If it is the first case, we would have applications
with exactly the same privacy policy while carrying out
different privacy practices. In contrast, the second case is
supported by evidence that Android privacy labels show
apparent inconsistencies with apps  code. As noted in
Section 4, 248 apps (44.3%) request permission to collect
coarse or precise location even though none of them are
disclosing it in the privacy labels. Moreover, we found 54
of those applications accessing these data in their source
code, neither reported on the labels.
Of course, accessing personal data that has not been
reported in the data collected section of the privacy labels
does not imply non-compliance. As stated in Section 2, in
privacy labels parlance  data collected  refers to

it is remarkable to notice that none of the apps found

Differences between the number of applications
disclosing collection of precise location and coarse
(approximate) location in Android and iOS . In figures
3 and 4 we could see that iOS apps mostly collect precise
location while Android does the same with coarse location.
 Apple considers as precise location the latitude and
longitude coordinates with three or more decimal places,
equivalent to a dispersion of 110 meters. Google does not
define what it considers as precise location but determines
that the approximate location is the one capable of locating
the user in an area of 3 square kilometers. On the other
hand, Apple considers approximate location to be the
latitude and longitude coordinates with two decimal places
or less, which is equivalent to 1.1 km of dispersion. Thus,
the divergences between the definitions of these two dataitems highlight the disparity between iOS and Android
privacy labels, but do not justify the noticeable differences

the same functionalities and app screenshots in both marketplaces,
 while only Android discloses health collection.
The main app s purpose is to   record and track your lung
function and symptoms, and automatically sync with your
doctor  , where evident health data collection is occurring.
6. Threats to validity
Construct validity . Not all data types can be compared
 among platforms, only those for which we have
found a one-on-one relationship. This may make our
comparison not generalizable to other data types. Thenumber of apps we have analyzed is large and the proposed
 method for finding iOS apps on Android has a high
accuracy, which has been increased by performing an indepth
 comparison between privacy policies. This makes
negligible the possible error of incorrectly matching one
app to another. However, obtaining such a high accuracy
along with the fact that not all applications disclose the
privacy labels, involved a considerable reduction in the
size of the evaluation dataset. The jadx tool decompiles
and builds Java files for all Android applications, even
if the construction of the source code is not properly
achieved. This may lead to an increase in false negative
cases of applications retrieving location data type which
nevertheless does not introduce false positive results.
External validity . App Store unlike Google Play Store
asks developers for a monthly fee to maintain apps on the
market. This divergence could lead to greater attention
on the app s details provided, and a lower number of
unmaintained apps when compared to Google Play Store.
This may also be a bias in favor of the iOS applications
when comparing the privacy labels.

 ## TITLE
 Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores
 ## ABSTRACT
 Apple and Android introduced privacy labels in 2020 and 2022 respectively as a way of providing consumers with succinct summaries of mobile apps’ more salient data practices. A number of apps are published in both stores, offering us the opportunity to compare their privacy label disclosures in the two app stores. This paper compares the data practices privacy labels are intended to capture in each store. It then proceeds to analyze the disclosures of 822 apps published in both app stores, focusing on possible discrepancies. This analysis reveals that privacy label disclosures of what is ostensibly the same mobile app can be quite different. We discuss the different possible reasons behind these differences, including the possibility that these discrepancies might be indicative of potential privacy compliance issues. In particular, focusing on data collection disclosures of five different data types (location, contact info, sensitive info, identifiers, and health & fitness) we find discrepancies between iOS and Google Play privacy label disclosures in 66.5% of the mobile apps we analyze.
