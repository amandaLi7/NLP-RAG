 Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View
 ## ABSTRACT
 Previous works on voice-face matching and voice-guided face synthesis demonstrate strong correlations between voice and face, but mainly rely on coarse semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for anthropometry science.

There are several previous works investigating recovering face
from voice. Most of them are from a 2D perspective [ 16,19,54],
which utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ 14,26] to
generate faces with voice as the condition. However, face recovering
from voice is ill-posed. [ 29] found that the recovery mainly focuses
on some semantics of the speaker. For example, attributes such as
ethnicity has weak or no function while gender and age tend to be
recovered. Since those models mainly rely on semantics, the results
are not identity-fidelity which means generated faces can look very
different from the original ones. In addition, for a 2D face image,
identity-unrelated factors like expressions, hairs, glasses, illumination,
 background, etc., are also involved in the recovery process
leading to noisy and unstable outcomes. Different from 2D images,
general 3D facial shape is represented by the 3D coordinates of a
number of points on its surface called vertices [ 4] which inherentlyarXiv 2307.13948v1  [cs.CV]  26 Jul 2023Conference 23, July 2023, Ottawa, Canada Xiang Li1, Y andong Wen2, Muqiao Y ang1, Jinglu Wang3, Rita Singh1, Bhiksha Raj1,4
excludes the identity-unrelated factors. Moreover, since the topology
of 3D facial shape is predefined and consistent across different faces,
we can easily measure the reconstruction accuracy with distances
between the predicted vertices and their ground truths.
Similar to our target, one recent work [ 47] attempts to recover 3D
faces from voice while, due to the lack of ground-truth 3D face scans,
they first generate 2D face images from voice and then reconstruct
3D faces guided by an off-the-shelf 3D face reconstruction model.
The noise enrolled in the 2D-to-3D face reconstruction makes the
result unconvincing. For example, any expression in the 2D face
from the first stage will force the reconstructed 3D fac

by the first-stage 2D face image.
In our method, we aim to disable all previously used semantics,
e.g., gender, age and emotion, and focus on the voice-face correlation
from a pure geometry view. Before introducing our method, let us
go back and understand how voice is generated by human beings.
voice is produced by phonatory structures (Fig. 1 (a)), e.g., vocal
tract and vocal cords. Specifically, when producing vowels, the vocal
cords vibrate with no obstruction in the vocal tract. In contrast, for
most consonants, the phonation purely depends on the vocal tract
resonance with a pulmonic airflow. The vocal tract can be assumed
as a filter that makes the phonemes versatile and personalized. With
the phonation mechanism of human beings, as shown in Fig. 1 (b),
Markel et al introduces linear predictive coding (LPC) [ 25] which
models phonation as a unit impulse signal modified by a stack of
tubes (vocal tract) and encodes personalized voice by vocal tract
coefficients. The LPC yields a good physical model of the vocal tract
with only voice inputs in an unsupervised manner. As the mouth
and nose serve as the most important parts of the vocal tract, we
hypothesize that their geometry should be encoded in the voice. With
the tight bind of muscles and skeletons, other parts of face geometry
may also be represented by voice.
Though voice and face geometry should have some correlations,
we have no idea about which part of the face voice can represent.
Constructing uncorrelated relations will lead to random results and
raise the model instability. To tackle this problem, we introduce
the voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm. Previous
 studies have shown that anthropometric measurements like
the dimensions of nasal cavities [ 42] or cranium [ 48,49] directly
influence the speaker s voices. In our voice-AM-face paradigm,
we first summarize a set of AMs from anthropometry litera

[10,11,32,38,55], then identify predictable AMs and use them to
guide the 3D face reconstruction by conducting AM-guided optimization.
 By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face
geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and
make the face geometry tractable. In addition, the analysis of AMs
also brings a new view to understanding voice-face correlation in a
fine-grained fashion.
Inspired by LPC which learns the shape of the vocal tract by producing
 voice, we utilize a phonatory module to facilitate voice representation
 learning for face geometry. Similar to the auto-regressive
impulse-by-filter model used in LPC, recently introduced denoising
diffusion probabilistic models [ 18] share a similar structure, which
samples a random noise with auto-regressive updating to form the
final result. Based on the structure similarity, we choose the diffusion
model as our phonatory module.With the predicted AMs, we reconstruct the facial shapes by an
optimization-based method, which first projects the 3D facial shapes
into a low-dimensional linear space [ 4]. By adjusting the coefficients
in low-dimensional space, we obtain different re-projected 3D facial
shapes. Though this paper mainly focuses on understanding the
relationship between the 3D facial shape and voice from a scientific
angle, this technique has its potential applications. For example,
the identity-fidelity facial shape can be used for criminal profiling
scenarios, such as hoax calls and voice-based phishing.
In this paper, we try to answer two core questions - (1) Is there a
correlation between face geometry and voice  (2) If so, which part
of the face can be represented by the voice  To fulfill our target, we
collect a large-scale dataset containing ground-truth 3D face scans

2.1 Voice-face Matching and Voice-guided Face
The human voice contains rich information that can be used to
recognize personality traits, such as speaker identity [ 6,24,33],
gender [ 22], age [ 15,30,39], and emotion status [ 43,51]. V oices
can also be used for monitoring health conditions [ 1] and other
medical applications [ 17]. Most existing works in this area focus
on predicting personality traits that are intuitively related to voice.
Such personality traits may have essential correlations between the
human voice and their faces [45].
Cross-modal voice-face matching [ 28,44,53] and cross-modal
verification [ 27,37,41] are tasks where voices are used as queries to
retrieve faces or vice versa, which have received increasing attention
in recent years. V oice-guided face synthesis is another related task,
which aims to generate coherent and natural lip movements, and
includes methods that drive template images [ 16,19,54] or template
face meshes [ 9] to talk by speech inputs, or replace lip movements
in a video with movements inferred from another video or speech
Unlike the existing work in related fields that are more focused on
semantic correlations between voice and face, our work investigates
the voice-face correlation from a geometry view by studying holistic
facial structures. There has been recent work that seeks to understand
 the correlations between voice and facial geometry by first
recovering 2D faces from voice

model our voice-face correlation from a pure geometry view without
the influence of any semantics.
2.2 Phonation and Anthropometry
The human voice is generated by phonatory structures, and the
phonation of different phonemes may be dependent on different
physiological structures. For example, the phonation of consonants
includes some airflow obstruction in the vocal tract, while vowels do
not. By utilizing such properties, it has been proven to be informative
and helpful in various tasks, including automatic speech recognition
 [ 12], speech enhancement [ 50] and emotion recognition [ 13].
Beyond those language-related usages, human attributes are also
predictable from voice. There is a substantial body of research on
inferring human attributes from a person s voice, including speaker
identity [ 7,34], age [ 3,31], gender [ 23], and emotion status [ 43,52].
The interaction between these physiological structures may play
an important role in the recovery of 3D faces from voice. More
specifically, the underlying skeletal and articulatory structure of the
face and the tissue covering them may govern the shapes, sizes, and
acoustic properties of the vocal tract that produces the voice. Linear

body parameters and characteristics, including skeletal proportions,
race, height, body size, etc. These characteristics may influence the

length of vocal cords, etc.

 uncertainty learning
 with a voice code 𝑒. On the other hand, inspired by the voice
production mechanism, we introduce a phonatory module as a constraint
 to facilitate the training of AM prediction. In particular, a
diffusion-based voice generation module is involved as the phonatory
 module which aims to imitate the voice identity conditioning
on the voice code 𝑒. After that, we select the AMs predictable from
voice for hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis is made for each
AM and states the AM is unpredictable from voice. We can successfully
 reject the corresponding null hypothesis if any AM estimation
is better than chance on a held-out validation set with statistical
significance. The final 3D facial shapes can be reconstructed by a
fitting process [5] based on the predictable AMs. This is conducted
by adjusting a set of coefficients in low-dimensional space, such
that the differences between the AMs of the generated 3D facial
shape and the predicted AMs are minimized. Intuitively, if there are
more predictable AMs spanning different locations of a face, the
reconstruction can be more indistinguishable.
3.3 Facial AM Prediction
In this section, we illustrate our method to predict facial AMs from
AM summarization. There is a large body of literature on anthropometry.
 Extensive studies show that many AMs of human faces
can be associated with voice production [ 10,11,32,38,55]. We
summarize the most commonly used AMs as shown in Fig. 3 (the
complete list of AMs is available in the appendix). The chosen
AMs are categorized as proportion, angles and distance of a set of
face landmarks. Those intra-face features are more robust than 3D
coordinate representations as the variations resulting from spatial
misalignment are completely eliminated.

 ## ABSTRACT
 Previous works on voice-face matching and voice-guided face synthesis demonstrate strong correlations between voice and face, but mainly rely on coarse semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for anthropometry science.

3.4 AM-Guided 3D Facial Shape Reconstruction
To reconstruct the 3D facial shape, we first need to predict AMs of
the voice recordings in D𝑒first. Subsequently, we generate the 3D
facial shapes based on the predicted AMs by an optimization-based
method. To do so, we first project the 3D facial shapes into a lowdimensional
 linear space [ 5]. By adjusting the coefficients in lowdimensional
 space, we obtain different re-projected 3D facial shapes.
The learning objective is to find a set of coefficients, such that the
differences between the AMs of the re-projected 3D facial shape and
the predicted AMs are minimized. Specifically, we construct a big
matrix𝐵 [𝑏1,𝑏2,   ]  R3𝑇  D 𝑡 where each column 𝑏𝑖 R3𝑇 1
is a long vector obtained by flattening a 3D facial shape 𝑓𝑖 R𝑇 3.
𝑇is the number of vertices on 3D faces. Since 3𝑇   D𝑡 , we
compute the project matrix 𝑃 R3𝑇 𝑑(𝑑 3𝑇)using eigenfaces
[5] on𝐵. Now any flattened 3D facial shape 𝑏can be approximated
by re-projecting a low-dimensional vector 𝛽 R𝑏 1in the form of
𝑃𝛽. We define the computation of AM as 𝑄𝑘(𝑏) 𝑏  R, which
maps any flattened 3D facial shape 𝑏into the𝑘-th AM of𝑏. Since
𝑄𝑘( )computes a distance, a proportion, or an angle of the 3D facial
shape, it is a differentiable function. The optimization objective is
𝑘 1(𝑄𝑘(𝑃𝛽) ˆ𝑚(𝑘))2 𝑧(𝑘)(7)
where𝜆is the loss weight balancing two terms. The reconstructed
3D facial shape is given by ˆ𝑏 𝑃𝛽 .

by (1) asking participants to speak a set of specified sentences, (2)
asking participants to speak without emotion, (3) control the age of
participants (roughly 18-28 years old). In addition, to prevent the
models from taking the gender shortcuts, we split the dataset Dby
gender, and experiments are individually performed on male and female
 subsets. For each subset, we adopt 7/1/1/1 splitting for D𝑡/D𝑣1
/D𝑣2/D𝑒. In training, the voice recordings are randomly trimmed
to segments of 6 to 8 seconds, while we use the entire recordings
in testing. The ground truth AMs are normalized to zero mean and
unit variance. For voice features, we extract 64-dimensional log Melspectrograms
 using an analysis window of 25ms, with the hop of

we have discovered a number of predictable female AMs (see the
gray bars and their 𝐶𝐼𝑢in Fig. 4 (b)). By filtering out the voice
samples with high uncertainties, we achieve even higher 1 𝐶𝐼𝑢(see
the red and yellow bars and their 𝐶𝐼s). The improved performance
indicates that more AMs are discovered as predictable from voice.
The complete results of all AMs are given in the appendix. The
results empirically demonstrate that the information of 3D facial
shape is indeed encoded in the voices and can be discovered by our
To intuitively locate the predictable AMs on the 3D face, we
visualize them in Fig. 5. We clearly observe that most of the predictable
 AMs are around nose and mouth, and many of them are
shared between male and female subsets. This is consistent with the
fact that nose and mouth shapes affect pronunciation.
We also notice that the performance of female subset is much
better than that of the male subset. To investigate whether the improvements

are still better than those on the male subset, as shown in Fig. 4 (c).
This is possible because the female subjects have higher nasalance

 useful information for predicting the AMs around the nose.

 Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View
 ## ABSTRACT
 Previous works on voice-face matching and voice-guided face synthesis demonstrate strong correlations between voice and face, but mainly rely on coarse semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for anthropometry science.

 ice. More investigations
are left for future work.
On the other hand, some AMs have not been shown to be predictable
 from voice. This observation suggests that voices may only
associate with a few specific regions of the 3D facial shape, like the
nose and mouth. For the AMs with higher errors than chance level,
we do not claim they are not predictable from voice. Instead, we fail
to demonstrate their predictability based on our current empirical
results. The possible reasons include imperfect modeling, limited
data, data noise, etc.
4.4 Effect of Phonatory Module
As presented in Table 1, it is evident that utilizing the phonatory
module during training enhances the accuracy of predicted AMs.
Our evaluation involved computing the normalized error across all
AMs with various confidence thresholds. Although the models with
and without the phonatory module exhibited a marginal difference in
error when evaluating all the data, the ones trained with the phonatory
 module showed a clear improvement in error when considering
more confident samples.
Furthermore, we conducted an error evaluation for predictable
and unpredictable AMs as depicted in Table 2. We observed that
utilizing the phonatory module resulted in a 0.102-point decrease in
normalized error for predictable AMs, highlighting its effectiveness
in improving the prediction performance. Interestingly, the phonatory
 module did not have any apparent effect on unpredictable AMs.
Overall, the results indicate that utilizing the phonatory module
during training is beneficial for predicting AMs, particularly for

We also experiment with the voice-face correlation at the phoneme
level. For this experiment, we train and evaluate estimators by taking
one phoneme as input each time. We computed the average 1 𝐶𝐼𝑢

results indicate that /i /had the highest average 1 𝐶𝐼𝑢value of

We observed that the three phonemes with the lowest and negative

consonants. During the pronunciation of plosive consonants, there
is a complete stoppage of airflow followed by a sudden release of
air through minimal mouth opening and closing. As a result, there
is minimal movement of the facial muscles and structures, making
it challenging for the model to predict AMs based solely on these

involve constriction of airflow in the vocal tract. Instead, the facial
muscles have relatively greater movement during the pronunciation
of these phonemes, such as jaw movement due to mouth opening or
lip spreading. Thus, vowel phonemes may carry more informationabout facial features, making it easier for the model to capture the
hidden correlation when predicting AMs.

 remaining data. The filter-out
rate is from 0% to 50%, as shown from left to right in Fig. 6.
Unsurprisingly, we achieve the lowest errors around the nose
region for male and female subsets, consistent with the AM estimations.
 Moreover, the reconstruction errors decrease significantly by
filtering out the voice samples with the highest uncertainties. This
indicates that the learned uncertainty is effectively associated with
the reconstruction quality and allows the system to decide whether
to trust the model or not.
In conclusion, this paper presents a novel approach to exploring the
voice-face correlation by focusing on the geometric aspects of the
face rather than relying on semantic cues such as gender, age, and
emotion. The proposed voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)face
 paradigm identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice to
guide 3D face reconstruction, which results in significant correlations
 between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as
the nasal cavity and cranium. This approach not only eliminates the
influence of unpredictable AMs but also offers a new perspective
on voice-face correlation, which can be valuable for anthropometry
science. The results of this study open up possibilities for future
research in this area, such as developing more accurate voice-guided
face synthesis techniques and a better understanding of the relationship
 between voice and facial geometry.Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation  A Geometry View Conference 23, July 2023, Ottawa, Canada

 ## TITLE
 Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View
 ## ABSTRACT
 Previous works on voice-face matching and voice-guided face synthesis demonstrate strong correlations between voice and face, but mainly rely on coarse semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for anthropometry science.
