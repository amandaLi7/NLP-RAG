We present PESCO, a novel contrastive learning
 framework that substantially improves the
performance of zero-shot text classification.
We formulate text classification as a neural
text matching problem where each document
is treated as a query, and the system learns the
mapping from each query to the relevant class
labels by (1) adding prompts to enhance label
 matching, and (2) using retrieved labels
to enrich the training set in a self-training
loop of contrastive learning. PESCO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark
text classification datasets. On DBpedia, we
achieve 98.5% accuracy without any labeled
data, which is close to the fully-supervised result.
 Extensive experiments and analyses show
all the components of PESCO are necessary for
improving the performance of zero-shot text
Text classification is the task of assigning relevant
category labels to each input document. It is an important
 problem in machine learning research with
a wide spectrum of applications, including sentiment
 analysis (Pang et al., 2002  Maas et al., 2011 
Socher et al., 2013  Tang et al., 2014), question answering
 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016, 2018), and intent
classification (Tur et al., 2010), etc. Recently, deep
neural networks have obtained remarkable improvements
 in text classification, including CNNs (Kim,
2014  Zhang et al., 2015), RNNs (Tang et al., 2015 
Yang et al., 2016), Transformers (Vaswani et al.,
2017), and more, thanks to the successful modeling
of contextualized representations.
Despite the remarkable progress, training wellperforming
 neural classifiers still requires a large
amount of human-labeled documents, which is
costly and time-consuming, especially for new
application domains. This stimulates the recent
trend of exploring self-supervised pre-training neural
 models on text classification tasks. In particu-lar, pre-trained language models (PTLMs) (Devlin
et al., 2019  Liu et al., 2019  Yang et al., 2019)
clearly stand out from other methods owing to the
pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data. Nevertheless,
 how to adapt PTLMs to downstream tasks
with less supervision remains an open question for
the research community, inviting new ideas to explore.
Prompt-based learning (Brown et al., 2020  Shin
et al., 2020  Liu et al., 2021  Li and Liang, 2021 
Gao et al., 2021a) has been actively studied to better
 adapt PTLMs to downstream tasks with the goal
of reducing human annotation effort. For example,
PET (Schick and Schütze, 2020) is a prompt-based
method for few-shot text classification. It formulates
 the task as a Cloze Test , where a PTLM is
used to predict the output label(s) by completing a
prompt concatenated right after an input document.
For example, the sentiment of a product review is
highly likely to be positive if a PTLM fills the word
 good  into the following input 
[Review]  It is a _ product.
This example shows that prompt-based learning
could unleash the potential power of a PTLM by
constructing the input format of a downstream task
in a way that closely resembles the PTLM pretraining
 objective, which is masked language modeling
Motivated by the recent success of prompt-based
learning, we propose PESCO, a novel self-training
framework for zero-shot classification that uses
prompts to enhance performance. The self-training
consists of two iterative steps, pseudo-label prediction
 and model update. To make label descriptions
more informative, we first put label descriptions
into some predefined prompts and call the enhanced
descriptions label-prompts. As depicted in Figure 1,
to predict the pseudo-label of a document, PESCO
formulates text classification as a neural matching
task. A pre-trained text encoder maps both docu-arXiv 2305.14963v1  [cs.CL]  24 May 2023ments and label-prompts into a shared embedding
space. A label whose embedding is closest to the
document is predicted as the pseudo-label.
To effectively update the text encoder with
pseudo-labels, we propose the Prompt-enhanced
Label-aware Cloze Test (PLCT), a contrastive
learning framework for self-training. The text encoder
 is trained to match a document and the text
relevant to its pseudo-label. The relevant texts include
 pseudo-label prompts and the key sentences
from the documents assigned to the same pseudolabel.
 The key sentence of each document is the
sentence most related to its pseudo-label.
In our experiments, we show that the iterative
self-training consistently improves the classification
 performance compared to the same model without
 self-training and that our proposed approach
substantially outperforms other strong zero-shot
classification baselines. On some datasets, the zeroshot
 results are even on par with a fully supervised
baseline. On the Dbpedia dataset, in particular,
PESCO achieves 98.5% accuracy without any labeled
In summary, the contributions of this paper are
1.We explore text classification in a neural
matching formulation enhanced by prompts.
We demonstrate that even without any finetuning
 on the text encoder, this straightforward
formulation is an effective method for zeroshot
 text classification.
2.The potential of contrastive learning for selftraining
 has not been explored. We show that
this is a promising direction for self-training
and can achieve state-of-the-art performance
on zero-shot text classification.
2.1 Contrastive Learning
Contrastive learning (CL) (Chopra et al., 2005 
Hadsell et al., 2006) is a metric learning method
that aims to pull closer similar inputs in the embedding
 space. Recently, the most popular and
efficient methods for CL involve batch contrastive
learning (He et al., 2019  Chen et al., 2020), which
put similar inputs (positive pairs) and dissimilar
inputs (negative pairs) in the same batch, simultaneously
 minimizing the distance of representations
from positive pairs, while maximizing the distance
Figure 1  In this example, there are three classes, whose
label descriptions are  sports ,  business , and  world 
respectively. We convert the descriptions into labelprompts
 by placing them into a template. The model
predicts a label whose label-prompt embedding is the
most similar to the document embedding.
The key to CL is how to construct positive samples.
 Based on downstream applications, there are
various ways to formulate the positive pairs. In
self-supervised pre-training, the positive pairs are
usually formulated by data augmentation. That is,
different versions of a distorted sample are treated
as a positive pair. In supervised contrastive learning
 (Khosla et al., 2020), the examples belonging
to the same class are viewed as a positive pair.
In NLP, CL is usually used as an additional selfsupervised
 pre-training to PTLMs because the sentence

are not ready to be used in downstream tasks (Li
et al., 2020). SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021b) employs
dropout as minimal data augmentation and obtains
state-of-the-art unsupervised sentence representations.
 In supervised SimCSE, the sentences with
entailment relation are viewed as a positive pair.
Other approaches for data augmentation include
sentence reformulation (Wu et al., 2020), back
translation (Fang et al., 2020), dual encoder (Carlsson
 et al., 2021), language model corruption (Meng
et al., 2021), and translation pairs (Wang et al.,
In addition, CL is a commonly used training
algorithm for neural text retrieval (Xiong et al.,
2021). Inverse cloze test (ICT) (Lee et al., 2019) is
the most commonly used contrastive pre-training
task for retrieval that predicts a randomly selected
sentence from the rest of the texts. It is also possible
 to construct positive pairs by leveraging the
document structures (Chang et al., 2020).
2.2 Self-training and Zero-Shot Text
Self-training Self-training (Yarowsky, 1995 
Nigam and Ghani, 2000  Lee, 2013  Xie et al.,2020) is a widely used approach for semisupervised
 learning and can have additive improvement
 to pre-training in both computer vision (Zoph
et al., 2020) and NLP (Du et al., 2021). The
paradigm of self-training is first using a pre-trained
base model as  teacher  to generate pseudo-labels
on unlabeled data. The pseudo-label is then used
to train a  student  model. The teacher-student
training is performed iteratively until convergence.
Zero-shot Text Classification Zero-shot classification
 aims to classify text using only label
names without human annotation. Self-training
has demonstrated impressive performance on fewshot
 (Mukherjee and Hassan Awadallah, 2020) and
zero-shot text classification. Unlike a few-shot
setting which can use supervised information to
obtain a base model, in zero-shot text classification,
 obtaining a base model is non-trivial. LOTClass
 (Meng et al., 2020) leverages PTLMs to
augment label descriptions with semantically related
 words and then find category-indicative words
among these related words to label documents.
They generalize the performance to the documents
without category-indicative words via self-training.
iPET (Schick and Schütze, 2020) formulates text
classification as a cloze test to help PTLMs understand
 the task. They design several types of
prompts for each dataset, and each type of prompt
trains an individual teacher model to annotate documents
 using self-training. A student model aggregates
 the knowledge from the teachers via knowledge
 distillation. In this work, we propose a novel
self-training method for zero-shot text classification
 that integrates self-supervised pre-training into
self-training in a contrastive learning framework.
3 Zero-shot Classification as Matching
In our zero-shot setting, there are Nunlabeled documents
 X {x1, x2,   , xN}and a set of label
descriptions C {c1, c2,   , cL}, where Ldenotes
 the number of classes. We aim to learn a
scoring function g(x, c)so that relevant document
and label description pairs can have higher scores.
A label whose label description has the highest
score is selected as model prediction 
Inspired by the recent success of pre-trained sentence
 encoder (Gao et al., 2021b  Chuang et al.,
2022) which has shown impressive performanceon matching relevant texts, we explore using pretrained
 encoders as g(x, cj). Specifically, as illustrated
 in Figure 1, we formulate zero-shot text classification
 as a neural text matching problem. Both
document and label descriptions are encoded into
dense vectors by a shared encoder. The matching
score can be obtained by measuring cosine similarity
 between dense vectors.
However, label descriptions are usually a few
words rather than a sentence with full semantics,
which makes PTLMs unable to fully understand
the meaning of the labels. To tackle this, query
reformulation (Nogueira and Cho, 2017  Petroni
et al., 2020) is a commonly used technique in retrieval
 to enhance the semantics of a query. This
technique can be further incorporated with promptbased
 learning (Schick and Schütze, 2020), which
has shown that adding prompts to a text helps
PTLMs understand classification tasks. We use
a prompt function p( )to convert a label descriptioncinto
 a prompt by placing label descriptions
into pre-defined templates. We design Ttemplates
for each dataset, and the scoring function is 
i 1sim(fθ(x), fθ(pi(c))),(2)
where fθ( )is a text encoder with parameters θ
that maps an input text to a dense embedding, and
sim( )is a similarity function. For the rest of our
paper, we use cosine similarity as sim( ). For simplicity,
 in the rest of the article, we use pjto refer
pi(cj), which is the  label-prompt  of label jwith
irandomly sampled from {1,   , T}.
PESCO is a simple but effective self-training framework
 for zero-shot text classification. Algorithm 1
gives an overview of PESCO. In our iterative selftraining
 loop, we first use a pre-trained sentence
encoder fθto generate pseudo-labels (i.e. predicted
 labels) by the matching process described
in Section 3. We then use the pseudo-labels to updatefθby
 Prompt-enhanced Label-aware Cloze
Test (PLCT), which leverages pseudo-labels to construct
 positive training pairs. We continue the selftraining
 process by iteratively generating pseudolabels
 and updating the model using the PLCT objective
 function.Figure 2  The framework of the PLCT. (A)Suppose the pseudo-label ˆy1forx1is1. We select s2
k1for the document x1because the embedding of s2
1is the most similar to the embedding of label-prompt p1.ˆx1is
the augmented version of x1, which removes s2
1fromx1.(B)We use kandˆxfrom part (A) to construct an example
batch of PLCT with batch size B  3. Similar to self-supervised training, we use ˆx1to retrieve k1because they are
from the same document. We use ˆx1to retrieve k2because x1andx2have the same pseudo-label. We also use x1
to retrieve the its pseudo-label-prompt p1.(C)We separate PLCT into LCT and PCL losses.
4.1 Prompt-enhanced Label-aware Cloze Test
We propose Prompt-enhanced Label-aware Cloze
Test (PLCT) to update our model using pseudolabels.
 As shown in Figure 2, PLCT consists of
two losses, Label-aware Cloze Test (LCT) loss
and Prompt Contrastive Loss (PCL). To compute
LCT, for each document, we first select a key sentence
 from the document that is most relevant to its
pseudo label. In LCT, given a document, the positive
 texts are the key sentences from the documents
belonging to the same pseudo-label. For PCL, the
positive texts for a document are its pseudo-label
prompt (i.e. the label-prompt of a pseudo-label).
We combine these two losses by putting the positive
 texts of LCT and PCL into the same batch of a
4.1.1 Label-aware Cloze Test

 t to
match the remaining texts. In a document, as some
sentences don t contain useful information, using
a randomly selected sentence for training is not an
optimal choice. Instead, we use pseudo-label to
select the key sentences. Note that we use  Cloze
Test  without  Inverse  because we use the remaining
 long texts to match its relevant short sentences,
which can be viewed as label descriptions.
As illustrated in Figure 2-(A), given an input
i}consists of nsentences
 and its predicted pseudo label ˆyi, its keysentence kiissj, where 
Here, g( )is the scoring function in Eq.(1). As
key sentence kiis more relevant to the pseudolabel
 than any other sentences in xi, optimizing
this objective is similar to minimize the distance
between a document and its pseudo-label in embedding
 space, so kican be viewed as an augmented
version of the pseudo-label prompt. Predicting the
augmented version can have additional training signal
 than simply predicting pseudo-label prompt.
We provide a real example of ˆxandkin Table. 1
and more examples can be found in the Appendix
Since key sentences are highly correlated to corresponding
 pseudo-label prompts, given a document,
 it should not only match its key sentence but
also key sentences in documents assigned to the
same pseudo-label as shown in Figure 2 (C)-1. We
use the supervised contrastive loss (Khosla et al.,
2020) to optimize LCT, which extends the SimCLR
 (Chen et al., 2020) to allow multiple positive
keys for a query in a supervised setting. Specifically,
 let I {1,   , B}be the set of the indices
of the texts in a batch, where Bdenotes the batch
size. The LCT loss LLCT is written as 
ˆk K(i)logesim(fθ(ˆxi),fθ(ˆk))/γ
j Iesim(fθ(ˆxi),fθ(kj))/γ.
Here, K(i)  {kj, j I  ˆyj  ˆyi}denotes the
keys belonging to the same pseudo class ˆyi, and γdenotes a temperature commonly-used in CL. To
prevent trivial training signal, the input document
isˆxi xi  {ki}rather than xi, where the key
sentence kiis removed.
4.1.2 Prompt Contrastive Loss
As the update target of self-training is to maximize
 the similarity between xiand its pseudo-labelprompt
 pˆyiin embedding space, we use the prompt
contrastive loss (PCL) LPCL to directly maximize
i Ilogesim(fθ(ˆxi),fθ(pˆyi))/γ
c Cesim(fθ(ˆxi),fθ(p(c)))/γ.
Depicted in Figure 2 (C)-2, this loss predicts ˆyi
4.2 Combining LCT and PCL
Naturally, to combine LCT and PCL, the simplest
way is to use LPCL LLCT as the final training
loss. However, we found that minimizing this loss
has limited improvement over minimizing LLCT or
LPCL alone. As depicted in Figure 2 (B), we come
up with a more effective approach that puts the
positive texts from these two losses into the same
batch. By doing so, pseudo keys kand pseudo
prompt pcan serve as mutually challenging negative
 samples, thus enhancing the representative
power through more difficult contrastive tasks. In
our experiment, this simple solution significantly
improves the performance.
Specifically, we use ˆxias a query to retrieve (1)
the key kifrom the same text xi, (2)K(i), the keys
belonging to the same pseudo class ˆyi, and (3) the
positive pseudo-label-prompt pˆyi. The PLCT loss

Interestingly, ˆxican be viewed as a challenging
 data augmentation of xifor predicting pseudolabel

sentence from xi. A model can make a prediction

Algorithm 1 describes PECOS self-training loop.
Our self-training algorithm is a simplified version
of noisy student training (Xie et al., 2020) that a

a teacher. The key idea of noisy student training
is that the teacher uses clean data without data
augmentation to generate pseudo-labels, while the
student learns to predict the pseudo-label on augmented
We first use pre-trained sentence encoder to initialize
 fθ( ). Then, in step 1, fθ( )serves as a
teacher to generate pseudo-labels from clean data

as a student that learns to increase the probability
of predicting pseudo-labels by minimizing LPLCT .
Step 2 is a noisy student training because the model
takes ˆxas input rather than clean x. The selftraining
 repeats step 1 and step 2 until convergence.

 ## TITLE
 PESCO: Prompt-enhanced Self Contrastive Learning for Zero-shot Text Classification
 ## ABSTRACT
 We present PESCO, a novel contrastive learning framework that substantially improves the performance of zero-shot text classification. We formulate text classification as a neural text retrieval problem where each document is treated as a query, and the system learns the mapping from each query to the relevant class labels by (1) adding prompts to enhance label retrieval, and (2) using retrieved labels to enrich the training set in a self-training loop of contrastive learning. PESCO achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text classification datasets. On DBpedia, we achieve 98.5% accuracy without any labeled data, which is close to the fully-supervised result. Extensive experiments and analyses show all the components of PESCO are necessary for improving the performance of zero-shot text classification.

 ## TLDR
 PESCO is presented, a novel contrastive learning framework that substantially improves the performance of zero-shot text classification and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text classification datasets.
 The details of other hyperparameters in the

classification datasets  (1) AG News   topic classification

We provide the label descriptions in Table 3.
The label descriptions of Yahoo Answers and AG
news are mainly from the original dataset, and the
label description of DBpedia is mainly from LOTClass
 (Meng et al., 2020).
5.2 Effect of Using Prompts
We investigate whether supplementing the label description
 with the prompt can help the model better
understand the meaning of the label, and thus improve
 the performance. In Table 3, we provide the
label descriptions and the prompts we use. For each
dataset, we manually design two prompts, where
the  [desc]  in the templates is the label description.
For example, given a label description  Health ,
the prompting function converts it into either  It is
about Health  or  Category  Health .
Our experiments showed that the choice of
prompts doesn t affect performance much as long
as reasonable prompts are given. For example, in
AG news, without self-training, the accuracy of using
  Category   label  news ,  This is about  label 
 news , and   label  news  are 76.4, 76.0, and
78.0 respectively. Furthermore, our scoring function,
 as described in Eq.(2), combines the scores of
different prompts, which further reduces the gap.
The performance gap among different prompts is
less than 2% without self-training and less than 1%
In Table 4, we analyze the effect of using
prompts on SimCSE without self-training. By comparing
 [1] with [2], we find that using prompts for
retrieval improves the performance on most of the
datasets, especially on AG News. We find that without
 the word  news , the model can not understand
the meaning of the class only with the description
 world . Using the prompt-enhanced SimCSE [2]
as the initial base model provides a better start for
self-training. However, comparing with the performance
 gap of [1] and [2] in Table 4, we observed
that the gap between [6] and [7] becomes smaller,Datasets Label Descriptions Prompts

which indicates that the effect of using prompts
decreases after self-training.
5.3 Zero-shot Text Classification
In Table 4, we compare our results against two stateof-the-art
 zero-shot text classification baselines,
LOTClass (Meng et al., 2020) and iPET (Schick
and Schütze, 2020). We select these two methods
as our baselines because they both employ selftraining
 for zero-shot classification. In [1], [2], and
[3], they do not employ self-training on unlabeled
data, so the Self-train column is  No . In [7], we
report the best results over 5 runs on PESCO single
model performance without an ensemble. We also
report the average, maximum, and minimum accuracy
 over 5 runs in Appendix Table 6. In [8], to see
the gap between zero-shot and fully-supervised settings,
 we train a typical BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)
classifier on a labeled training set. We jointly finetune
 BERT and a linear classifier on top of BERT
Effect of Self-training First, by comparing [7]
against [2] in Table 4, we find that the proposedself-training framework significantly improves the
performance by more than 10% on average. On DBpedia,
 self-training improves performance substantially
 by 20%, and it even achieves 98.5% accuracy.
This demonstrates that self-training is an effective
method to enhance performance after general pretraining,
 closing the gap between fully supervised

PTLMs to find the category-indicative words which
are semantically related to label descriptions. The
documents containing category-indicative words
are classified as the corresponding category. Our
method uses a pre-trained sentence encoder to define
 the relevance between document and category,
which is more effective and requires less human

ries of self-training steps. We find that our base
model [2] achieves similar performance with [3]
on all datasets except Ag News, on which ours lags
behind by 3%. The lesson here is that using text
retrieval as a means of text classification gives a
similar performance to that using cloze tests. Next,
our full model [7] is also better than [4] iPET on
three datasets while achieving similar performance
on the Amazon dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness
 of our method. Also, we notice that PET
requires a massive model ensemble (e.g. 15 models)
 to achieve the reported accuracy. We run their
code with a PvP ensemble without using various
random seeds for ensembling.

 ## TLDR
 PESCO is presented, a novel contrastive learning framework that substantially improves the performance of zero-shot text classification and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text classification datasets.
  Even with this simplified
 setting, iPET still needs far more disk space
(1.4 GB vs 26 GB) and more training time than us
in that we do not need to train various models for
model ensembling in each self-training step.
Note that It is not feasible to test our method
using Roberta-base/large because language models
without SimCSE finetuning poorly capture the semantic
 meaning of texts in cosine similarity space
and cannot be used for retrieval. On the other
hand, simCSE is finetuned for sentence embeddings,
 making language models lose text generation
ability. Because iPET and LOTClass require language
 models to generate tokens, using SimCSERoberta
 for iPET or LOTClass is also not feasible.
5.4 Ablation Study and Analysis
Comparison of different contrastive losses The
results of different contrastive learning losses are
shown in Table 5. In the table, LCT means we
only use LLCT in Eq.( 4) to train our model, PCL
means we use LPCL, and LCT PCL means we
sum the LLCT andLPCL as our loss function
rather than using PLCT loss which puts keys and
label-prompts in the same batch. The methods end
with  -R  means the pseudo positive sentences k
are randomly selected from the documents instead
of picking the most salient sentences.In LCT, although it doesn t explicitly minimize
the distance between an input document and its predicted
 pseudo-label-prompt, optimizing this loss
still obtains performance similar to PLC. This implies
 the selected key sentences can serve as augmented
 version of label-prompts.
Furthermore, we analyze the difference in the
performance between using randomly selected sentences
 and the most salient sentences. By comparing
 [1] and [2], and [3] and [4], we can see
that the model has a significant performance drop
in predicting randomly selected sentences. This
demonstrates the importance of choosing a salient
sentence as the training target.
Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of
putting pseudo-label-prompts and key sentences
in the same batch, we compare [1] against [6]. [1]
yields better performance than [6], which implies
using this more challenging contrastive task allows
the model to learn more general representations.
Effect of Data Augmentation In Table 5, [7]
PESCO w/o aug means we use xias a query to
retrieve its positive examples A(i)instead of using
ˆxias a query. Comparing [1] and [7], removing
the most salient sentence from a document is an effective
 data augmentation method that can greatly
improve performance. This is consistent with previous
 literature (Xie et al., 2020) that updating
student models with noisy data is important in selftraining.
This paper presents a novel approach to zero-shot
text classification, which significantly improves the
SOTA results on four benchmark datasets by formulating
 the classification task as a prompt-enhanced
retrieval problem and by combining the strengths of
pre-trained language models and contrastive learning
 over pseudo-labeled data in a self-training loop.
Our experiments in comparison with representativebaselines and ablation analysis show evidence for
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The main limitation of our method is that it heavily
depends on the quality of the label description. If
a label description does not precisely describe the
meaning of the label, our method cannot work. For
some classification tasks such as microaggression
detection, their labels have abstract meaning that is
difficult to be understood by pre-trained language
models. Similarly, our method cannot work on
the domain that is not covered by the pre-training
corpora of language models, such as the medical
Another limitation of our method is that PLCT
loss cannot handle short texts. If a text consists of
only one sentence, PLCT loss will no longer work
because LCT requires a document to be more than
one sentence. In this case, PCL loss can still be
used for self-training.

 ## TITLE
 PESCO: Prompt-enhanced Self Contrastive Learning for Zero-shot Text Classification
 ## ABSTRACT
 We present PESCO, a novel contrastive learning framework that substantially improves the performance of zero-shot text classification. We formulate text classification as a neural text retrieval problem where each document is treated as a query, and the system learns the mapping from each query to the relevant class labels by (1) adding prompts to enhance label retrieval, and (2) using retrieved labels to enrich the training set in a self-training loop of contrastive learning. PESCO achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text classification datasets. On DBpedia, we achieve 98.5% accuracy without any labeled data, which is close to the fully-supervised result. Extensive experiments and analyses show all the components of PESCO are necessary for improving the performance of zero-shot text classification.

Text Classification as neural text retrieval Formulating
 text classification as neural retrieval is
straightforward but not widely explored by previous
 work. In this work, we show that this formulation
 can also obtain good performance with a
well-pre-trained sentence encoder. The benefit of
this formulation over cloze test is that we don t
need to restrict the label description to only one
word. PET requires a carefully selected word (verbalizer)
 to represent each class. If a classification
task has hundreds or even more than thousands of
categories, it is not feasible to manually select a
word to represent each class. Furthermore, if the
meaning of a category in a classification task is too
abstract or complex, we cannot simply represent
it with a single word. Our formulation allows the
model to describe categories using sentences or
even short texts and maybe a better choice for more
challenging classification tasks.
Contrastive Learning for Self-training The effect
 of contrastive learning for self-training is not
well-studied by previous work. Contrastive learning
 obtains impressive results on unsupervised representation
 learning. In a supervised setting, it is
also robust to noisy labels and noisy data, and it
also shows impressive performance on a few-shot
classification. Considering these good properties of
contrastive learning, we believe contrastive learning
 is a promising direction for self-training and
propose PESCO to explore its potential on zeroshot
 text classification.
As indicated by previous work (Chen et al., 2020),
using a larger batch size generally yields better performance
 because it includes more negative samples.
 We analyze how different batch size influences
 the performance of PESCO in Figure 3. We
found that PESCO is not very sensitive to batch
size. Using a smaller batch size only reduces the accuracy
 by less than 2%. Also, we observe that our
Figure 3  The effect of different batch sizes.
Figure 4  Training epoch versus validation set accuracy
algorithm converges after 1000 steps (1 epoch) of
training, and additional training steps only slightly
increase the performance. In other datasets, our
algorithm also converges after 1 training epoch.
We list the hyperparameters of our model in Table
 7. We use AdamW as our optimizer. The T 
is the threshold mentioned in Section 4.3, we set
it proportional to N, where Nis the total number
of unlabeled data in the corresponding dataset. We
find that the number of training epoch only slightly
influence the final performance that usually influences
 the accuracy by less than 1%. In Figure 4, we
plot the training epoch versus validation set accuracy.
 Although we train 5 epochs on the AG news
to obtain the best result, the model actually converges
 in the early training stage. Similar training
curves can be observed in all the datasets.AG News DBpedia Yahoo Answers Amazon
