Event grounding aims at linking mention references in text

Events in documents are typically described at various levels
 of spatio-temporal granularity (Glavaˇ s et al. 2014). T hese

we present an extension to the event grounding task that requires

proposed task involves linking a mention reference to a set o f
event labels from a subevent hierarchy in the KB. We propose
 a retrieval methodology that leverages event hierarch y
through an auxiliary hierarchical loss (Murty et al. 2018). On
an automatically created multilingual dataset from Wikipe dia

Grounding entity and event references from documents to
a large-scale knowledge base (KB) is an important component
 in the information extraction stack. While entity link ing
has been extensively explored in the literature (Ji and Gris hman
 2011), event linking is relatively unexplored.2Recently,

Prior work studied hierarchical relations between events
as a part of datasets and systems proposed for narrative understanding
 (Glavaˇ s et al. 2014), event sequencing (Mitamura,
 Liu, and Hovy 2017) and schema construction (Du
et al. 2022). These works focused on hierarchical relations
between mentions (e.g., subevent). In this work, we instead
focus on hierarchical relations between grounded mentions
(i.e., events in a KB). This allows for studying hierarchy at
a coarser level and leverages information across numerous
mentions. To this end, we extend Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura
 (2022) to include hierarchical event structures fro m
Wikidata (Figure 1). In contrast to prior work, our formulation
 captures the hierarchical aspects by including nonleaf
 events such as  Operation Overlord  and  Western Front
(World War II) . Our formulation presents a challenging
variant of the event linking task by requiring systems to dif ferentiate
 between mentions of child and parent events.
For the proposed hierarchical linking task, we present a
baseline that adopts the retrieve & re-rank paradigm, which
has been previously developed for entity and event linking
 tasks (Wu et al. 2020  Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura

(Song et al. 2015), TAC-KBP (Mitamura, Liu, and Hovy

3 Hierarchical Event Grounding
The task of grounding involves linking event references in
text documents to the corresponding entries in a knowledge
 base (Chandu, Bisk, and Black 2021). Pratapa, Gupta,
and Mitamura (2022) studied linking event references from
Wikipedia and Wikinews articles to Wikidata items. However,
 they restrict the dictionary of Wikidata items to leaf
events. This ignores important parent events such as  Operation
 Overlord  and  Western Front (World War II)  from
Figure 1. In our preliminary analysis, we observed a signiﬁcant
 number of mentions that refer to the parent events,
motivating us to expand the dictionary to include all events .
Modeling hierarchy relations between events has been extensively
 studied (Glavaˇ s et al. 2014  Mitamura, Liu, and
Hovy 2017  Du et al. 2022). These works typically focus
on hierarchical relations among mentions in a document. In
contrast, we focus on hierarchical relations among events i n
a KB. At a high level, this can be viewed as a combination
of coreference resolution and hierarchy relation extracti on.
Consider an event knowledge base ( K) that constitutes a set
of events ( E) and their relations ( R). Each event ( ei E)
has an id, title, and description. The relation set ( R) includes
both temporal and hierarchical (parent-child) links betwe en

 task is to predict an unordered subset of events
(Em E). This set Emconstitutes events within a hierarchy
 tree, from the leaf to the root of the tree.4In Figure
1, the mention  Normandy campaign  is to linked to the set
{Q8641370, Q216184 }, whereas the mention  Falaise Gap 
is linked to {Q602744, Q8641370, Q216184 }.
We follow prior work on linking (Logeswaran et al. 2019)
to formulate the task in a zero-shot fashion. Speciﬁcally, t he
set of event hierarchies for evaluation is completely unsee n
during training. Following Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura
(2022), we present two task variants, 1. Multilingual , where
the event title and description are given in the same languag e
as the mention and its context, and 2. Crosslingual , where
the event title and description are in English.
An alternate task formulation involves traditional event
linking followed by hierarchy propagation in the KB. However,
 such a formulation requires access to gold hierarchy
relations at test time. In contrast, we present a task that fa cilitates
 hierarchy relation extraction among unseen even ts.
3.2 Hierarchical Relation Extraction
In addition to our key focus task of event linking, we explore
 hierarchical relation extraction for events. Simila r to
standard KB relation extraction (Trouillon et al. 2016), th is
involves predicting parent-child relationships in the KB.
Speciﬁcally, given a hierarchical triple (ec,r,ep)inK,
whereecis the child of epandris the child  parent relation,
 we mask epand task models to retrieve it from the
pool of events in K. To this end, we present a methodology
to utilize our trained event-linking system for hierarchic al
relation extraction in Wikidata ( 5.3).
To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing datasets
for the task of hierarchical event linking. Therefore, we ex pand
 the XLEL-WD dataset (Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura
2022) to include hierarchical event structures.

 a three-step process to collect events and their mentions.
 First, events are identiﬁed from Wikidata items by de termining
 whether they have caused a change of state and
possess spatio-temporal attributes. Then each event is ass ociated
 with a set of language Wikipedia articles following
the pointer contained in the event Wikidata item page. The
title and description for each event in different languages
are therefore obtained by taking the title and ﬁrst paragrap h
of the associated language Wikipedia article. Finally, men tions
 linked to each event are collected by iterating over th e
language Wikipedia and identifying hyperlinks to the event associated
 Wikipedia articles (obtained in the previous st ep).
The anchor text of hyperlinks is taken as mentions and the
surrounding paragraph of each mention is extracted as context.

Solid arrows ( ) and dotted arrows ( ) denote hierarchical

4.2 Hierarchy Construction
We further organize the collected pool of events into hierarchical
 trees by exploring property nodes from Wikidata.
Property nodes act as edges between Q-nodes in Wikidata.
We utilize two asymmetric and transitive properties, haspart
 (P527) and part-of (P361). Given two events, e1and
e2, if there exist edges such that e1has-parte2ore2partofe1,
 we mark e1as the parent event e2and add the edge
(e2, part-of,e1) into the hierarchies. The full hierarchies are
yielded by following such procedure and iterating over the
full set of candidate events collected in  4.1.
For zero-shot evaluation, the train and evaluation splits
should use disjoint hierarchical event trees from Wikidata .

shown in Figure 2, event trees can be a part of a larger
temporal sequence. For instance, the events  2016 Summer
Olympics , and  2020 Summer Olympics  share very similar
 hierarchical structure. To overcome this issue, we instead
 split events based on connected components of both
hierarchical and temporal relations. In particular, candi date
events are ﬁrst organized into connected components that
are grown by the two hierarchical properties  has-part and
part of and two temporal properties  follows (P155) and
followed-by (P156). The connected components are then assigned

 includes only events that are part of a hierarchy
(event tree) of height  1. However, to conduct realistic evaluations

events belong to any hierarchy, all the events collected in
 4.1, no matter whether they are part of a hierarchy or not,
are presented to models as candidates at inference time.Train Dev Test Wikinews

4.5 Dataset Statistics
To this end, we automatically compile a dataset with event
hierarchies of maximum height  3 that consists of 2K events
and 937K across 42 languages. The detailed statistics of the
train-dev-test split as well as the Wikinews evaluation set
(WN) are presented in Table 1. Other than the events within
hierarchies, we use the full set of events (including single tons)
 as the pool of candidates, this expands the effective
size of our event dictionary to nearly 13k.
We perform a human evaluation of the parent-child relations
 in the development split of our dataset.5We ﬁnd the
accuracy to be 96.7%, highlighting the quality of our hierar chical

5.2 Encoding Hierarchy
The baselines described above enable linking mentions to
multiple KB events. However, they predict a ﬂat set of
events, overlooking any hierarchical relationships among st
them. To explicitly incorporate this hierarchy, we add a
hierarchy aware loss in the bi-encoder training (Murty
et al. 2018). In addition to scoring mention-event pairs,
the bi-encoder is also optimized to learn a scoring function
s(ep,ec)with the parent-child event pair ep,ec  K.
We parameterize sbased on the ComplEx embedding
(Trouillon et al. 2016). It has been shown to be effective
in scoring asymmetric, transitive relations such as hypernym
 in WordNet and hierarchical entity typing (Murty et al.
2018  Chen, Chen, and Van Durme 2020). ComplEx transforms
 type and relation embeddings into a complex space
and scores the tuple with the real part of the Hermitian inner
product. In our implementation, we use only the asymmetric
portion of the product.
In particular, given the embeddings of parent-child event
pairep,ec  K asep,ec Rdrespectively, the score
s(ep,ec)is obtained by

optimized with both the hierarchy-aware and mention

with the hierarchy-aware loss, followed by joint training
with the hierarchy-aware and mention linking loss.
For each of the above bi-encoder conﬁgurations, we train
a cross-encoder using the same training recipe as the baseline.
 We leave the development of hierarchy-aware crossencoder
 models to future work.
5.3 Hierarchical Relation Extraction
In addition to the mention-linking, we propose a methodology
 to leverage the trained bi-encoders for hierarchical re lation
 extraction. For each mention, we ﬁrst retrieve the top- k
event candidates. We then construct a list of mentions ( Me)
for each event ein the dictionary. Finally, given a pair of
events (ei,ej), we compute a score for potential child-parent
(ei ej) relation as follows,
The scoring function his derived based on the intuition that
ifejis the parent event of ei, then all the mentions which
are linked to eishould also be linked to ejby our linker. In
such case, Meiwould be the subset of Mejwhich indicates
thath(ei,ej)   1 approaches its maximum.
For each event, we iteratively calculate the child-parent
score with every other event and rank them in descending
order of the hscore. With this process, we could obtain a
ranking of all other events as its candidate parents.
We experiment with the proposed conﬁgurations of
bi-encoders and corresponding cross-encoders on the
Wikipedia dataset for both multilingual and crosslingual
tasks. To further assess out-of-domain generalization per formance,
 we conduct the same experiments for baseline
and the best-performing hierarchy-aware system on th

 task, we evaluate the approach proposed in  5.3 based
on the retrieval results of the best-performing bi-encoder .6.1 Metrics
Bi-encoder  For bi-encoder, we follow prior work to report
 Recall@ kand extend it to multi-label version  measuring
 the fraction of mentions where all the gold events contained
 in the top- kretrieved candidates. Since the longest
path of hierarchies in the collected dataset consists of 4
events, we only evaluate with k 4. And for k  4, we
instead report Recall@ min  the fraction of mentions where
all the gold events contained in the top- xretrieved candidates,
 where xis the number of gold events for that mention.
Recall@ minmeasures whether the bi-encoder could predict
all and only the gold events with the minimal number of
retrievals. For cases with single gold event, Recall@ min 
Recall@1 which falls back to single event linking.
Our task requires the model to predict all the relevant
events, from the atomic event to the root of the hierarchy
tree. As an upper bound for model performance, we also
report scores for predicting the most atomic event. In particular,
 the set of gold events is considered fully containe d
in top-kretrieval of a mention if the most atomic gold event
in the hierarchy is contained in the top- kcandidates. Our
original task reduces to this atomic-only prediction task i f
the event hierarchy is known at test time. However, such an
assumption might not be true in real-world settings.
While Recall@ kis a strict and binary metric, i.e. the retrieval
 is counted as successful if and only if all the gold
events are predicted, we further introduce a fraction versi on
of it, denoted as Recall@ k(fraction), that allows for partial
retrieval, with details in Appendix D.1.
Cross-encoder  Similar to bi-encoder, we also follow previous
 work on entity linking to evaluate strict accuracy ,

We additionally evaluate the strict accuracy of crossencoders
 where we report the top- xreranked candidates as
predictions with xbeing the number of gold events linked
with the mention. This is the same condition as evaluating
the bi-encoder on Recall@ min. It enables a direct comparison
 of strict accuracy to Recall@ minsuch that to assess if
cross-encoders make improvements on bi-encoders. We denote
 the strict accuracy calculated under this condition as
strict accuracy (top min) .Hierarchical Relation Extraction  As deﬁned in  3.2,
we evaluate the proposed hierarchical relation extraction
method on whether it could identify the parent for a given
child event. In particular, given an event with a ranked list
of candidate parents (generated by the proposed method),
we measure Recall@ kfor the gold parent in the list. Since
Recall@kis ill-deﬁned for events without a parent, we only
calculate it for the non-root events within hierarchies of d ev
and test set. For those events that have parents but are not
linked to any mentions by the bi-encoder, they are added as
miss at every k. Such evaluation with Recall@ kmeasure is
similar to the HIT@ kevaluation in the KB link prediction
literature (Bordes et al. 2011).

Given the top- kretrieval results from each of the aforementioned
 bi-encoders, we train and evaluate a unique crossencoder
 respectively. The value of kused for all cross-encoder
experiments is selected to balance retrieval qualities (i. e. biencoder

the negative candidates with the current lowest probabilit y
and repeat this process until all the missing gold events are
added. At inference time, we apply a threshold τcto the
reranked event candidates and emit those with score  τc
as ﬁnal predictions. If there is no event yielded, we add a
NULL event to the prediction.
Hierarchical Relation Extraction   We apply the proposed
 method to top-4 retrieval results from the bestperforming
 bi-encoder to perform hierarchical relation ex traction.
7 Result and Analysis
Bi-encoder retrieval results on the dev split for both multi and
 cross-lingual tasks are illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure
 4 respectively. Since the gain in Recall@ kis relatively
minor when doubling kfrom 8 to 16 across all conﬁgurations
 and tasks, the cross-encoder is trained with the top
8 retrieved candidates, with the consideration of computation
 efﬁciency. It is also shown that all conﬁgurations atta in

atomic event only (set of dense dots vs line plots), which
reﬂects the beneﬁts of following the gold hierarchies and in dicates

 performance on macro/micro F1. On the crosslingual
task, (d) is the only hierarchy-aware system that outperfor ms
the baseline across all metrics. All the models attain bette r
results with Top Min accuracy and the relative performance
differences between them remain similar to that of normal
accuracy. Similar to the bi-encoder, the large performance
gap of cross-encoders between the two tasks conﬁrms that
the crosslingual setting is more challenging.

We further investigate whether the cross-encoder could
make improvements on its bi-encoder across all conﬁgurations.
 As discussed in  6.1, by comparing the strict accuracy
 of cross-encoders under the Top Min condition with the
Recall@ minof associated bi-encoders, we ﬁnd that crossencoders
 further enhance bi-encoder performance on the tes t
set in multilingual tasks while underperforms in other case s.
For closer inspection into the performance of systems on

Previous work on this task focused primarily on linking to a single KB event, thereby overlooking the hierarchical aspects of events. Events in documents are typically described at various levels of spatio-temporal granularity. These hierarchical relations are utilized in downstream tasks of narrative understanding and schema construction. In this work, we present an extension to the event grounding task that requires tackling hierarchical event structures from the KB. Our proposed task involves linking a mention reference to a set of event labels from a subevent hierarchy in the KB. We propose a retrieval methodology that leverages event hierarchy through an auxiliary hierarchical loss. On an automatically created multilingual dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical loss against retrieve and re-rank baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the systems' ability to aid hierarchical discovery among unseen events. Code is available at https://github.com/JefferyO/Hierarchical-Event-Grounding

8 Conclusion & Future Work
In this paper, we present the task of hierarchical event
grounding, for which we compile a multilingual dataset with
Wikipedia and Wikidata. We propose a hierarchy-loss based
methodology that improves upon a standard retrieve and rerank
 baseline. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
 of our approaches to model hierarchies among events
in both multilingual and crosslingual settings. Additiona lly,
we show promising results for zero-shot hierarchical relation
 extraction using the trained event linker. Some potent ial
directions for future work include adapting encoders to directly
 include hierarchy and further exploring hierarchic al
relation extraction on standard datasets.

 ## TITLE
 Hierarchical Event Grounding
 ## ABSTRACT
 Event grounding aims at linking mention references in text corpora to events from a knowledge base (KB). Previous work on this task focused primarily on linking to a single KB event, thereby overlooking the hierarchical aspects of events. Events in documents are typically described at various levels of spatio-temporal granularity. These hierarchical relations are utilized in downstream tasks of narrative understanding and schema construction. In this work, we present an extension to the event grounding task that requires tackling hierarchical event structures from the KB. Our proposed task involves linking a mention reference to a set of event labels from a subevent hierarchy in the KB. We propose a retrieval methodology that leverages event hierarchy through an auxiliary hierarchical loss. On an automatically created multilingual dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical loss against retrieve and re-rank baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the systems' ability to aid hierarchical discovery among unseen events. Code is available at https://github.com/JefferyO/Hierarchical-Event-Grounding
