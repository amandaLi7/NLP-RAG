 ## TITLE
 Generalized Glossing Guidelines: An Explicit, Human- and Machine-Readable, Item-and-Process Convention for Morphological Annotation
 ## ABSTRACT
 Interlinear glossing provides a vital type of morphosyntactic annotation, both for linguists and language revitalists, and numerous conventions exist for representing it formally and computationally. Some of these formats are human readable; others are machine readable. Some are easy to edit with general-purpose tools. Few represent non-concatentative processes like infixation, reduplication, mutation, truncation, and tonal overwriting in a consistent and formally rigorous way (on par with affixation). We propose an annotation conventionâ€”Generalized Glossing Guidelines (GGG) that combines all of these positive properties using an Item-and-Process (IP) framework. We describe the format, demonstrate its linguistic adequacy, and compare it with two other interlinear glossed text annotation schemes.

As part of the ongoing wav2gloss project, we are
generating Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) from
speech using an end-to-end system. In producing
 IGT for various languages of the Americas,
weencounteredachallenge  traditionalinterlinear

IGTnotationsisthattheyrepresentthealignment

show how non-concatenative processes align to
The contrast between concatenative and nonconcatenative
  models of grammatical description 
 goes back at least to a seminal article by
CharlesHockett( 1954)inwhichheobservedthat

 associatedwithmeaning  morphemes
 (items) and processes. The pipeline assumed
 by GGG is one in which morphemes are
first assembled via concatenation (a MORPHEMIC
REPRESENTATION ). At this level, each instance of
the same morpheme has the same form (except
in cases of suppletion). Then, processes apply to
these strings. Together, the items and processes

Phonological rules may apply to the lxrepresentation,
 yielding phonologically conditioned allomorphy.
 Some cases of nasalization shown in
thesrfield in Figure 1are phonological. Since
nasalizationisnotassociatedwithanymeaning,it
doesnotcorrespondtolabelsinthegloss( gl).
InGGG,the lxrepresentstheapplicationofprocesses
 to morphemes mapping between a MORPHEMIC
 REPRESENTATION and an UNDERLYING REPRESENTATION
 . The bracket-and-arrow notation
shown in ( 3b) and (4b) above describes rewrites
between the morphemic form and the underlying
form. Thatistosay,themorphemicrepresentation
is everything outside of the brackets interspersed
with everything to the left of the arrows ( ) and

2.2 GGG is purely descriptive
ThegoalofGGGis nottoprovideadeeptheoreticalaccountofmorphologybutrathertobepurely

 by autosegmental tones being  bumped

Note that these changes are morphologically
(not phonologically) conditioned. In ( 5a), GGG
represents the tonal morphology as /1/ being replaced
 by /4/ and (the second) /4/ being preceded
by an inserted /1/, focusing on the superficial (insertion
 of /1/ in the second mora) rather than the
deeprelationship(reassingmentofthesame/1/to
the second mora) between the morphemic representationandtheunderlyingrepresentation(thein-
puttothephonologicalrules).
GGG attempts to represent IGT examples like
those in the preceding section in a YAML format,

that are present when linguists typeset linguistic
data for the consumption of other linguists. This
alliesitwiththeSILShoeboxformatanddifferentiatesitfromXigt(

 easy to edit GGG text using off-the-shelf

Conventions for associating gloss tokens with
morpheme tokens (see Table 2) are based on the
Leipzig glossing conventions with significant extensions.
 When possible, labels for categories
are derived from the Unimorph schema ( SylakGlassman,2016).
Each gloss token consists of a lexical or morpheme
 gloss followed by a sequence of process
glosses(eachenclosedincurlybrackets)andzero
or one delimiters {  ,-} which may be either preposed
 or postposed. Process glosses consist of
lexical glosses or morpheme glosses and an optionalsemicolonfollowedbyalistofnumberssep-
 by commas. The numbers indicate the indexofspans(startingfrom1)inthecorresponding
formtheglossappliesto. Forexample, inArabic
k{i u}t{aː u}b  book{PL 1,2} ,thePLproperty
is realized by two changes ({ u} and { u}) and
thisisindicatedbythespanindices(1,2)afterthe
semicolon. Foreaseofannotation,ifthereisonly
oneprocessinaword,theindexcanbeomitted.
Some form tokens have more than one associated
 process. The corresponding glosses
are provided in successive bracketed expressions
 after that lexical or morpheme gloss.
For example, in Arabic k{ a}t{ ː}{ a}b{ a}62 write{PST 1,3}{CAUS 2}{3.SG.M 4} ,thereare

in brackets with their respective indices. The use
of indices means the alignment between bracketedexpressionsinformsandglossesisdetermin-
 The orders of the processes (bracketed expressions)
 in the gloss can be arbitrary, but as a
group they should appear only at the end of the
Morpheme glosses are drawn from the UnimorphSchema(
 Sylak-Glassman ,2016)whenpossible.6Whenglossesforderivationalmorphology
are present in the Leipzig Rules but not in Unimorph,
 the Leipzig gloss should be used. When
a needed category is not represented in either resource,itwillbeaddedtothestandard.
Super-categoriesoffeaturesarerepresentatedas
CATEGORY   . Thus, first-person plural subject is
representedas SUBJ  1.PL .
Disjunctions between properties can indicated
with the pipe (  ) operator and grouping can
be indicated with square brackets. The  operator
 binds more closely than the .operator.
 Thus, English youmay be glossed (out
of context) as 2.SG PL.NOM ACC (second person,
singular or plural and nominative or accusative.
Square brackets can be used for grouping. German
 siecan be glossed (out of context) as
3.[SG.FEM] [PL.NOM ACC] (third person, either
feminine singular or unspecified for gender and
plural and either nominative or accusative). Disjunctionsaretobeusedwhentheexactanalysisof
a wordform, in context, is not clear to an annotator.
 In general, their use should be minimized as

that three sequences, lx,sr, and gl, are the same

This means that context-free parsing for GGG is
not possible. This adds some overhead to writing

The adequacy of GGG for annotating concatenativemorphologyisidenticaltothatofLGR,since
the mechanism is borrowed from LGR directly.

convention works well for infixation, reduplication,truncation,apophony,tonaloverwriting,seg-
 overwriting, transfixation, and other similarprocesses.
Infixation involves the inserting of a morpheme
into a morpheme. Take the following examples

 ## TITLE
 Generalized Glossing Guidelines: An Explicit, Human- and Machine-Readable, Item-and-Process Convention for Morphological Annotation
 ## ABSTRACT
 Interlinear glossing provides a vital type of morphosyntactic annotation, both for linguists and language revitalists, and numerous conventions exist for representing it formally and computationally. Some of these formats are human readable; others are machine readable. Some are easy to edit with general-purpose tools. Few represent non-concatentative processes like infixation, reduplication, mutation, truncation, and tonal overwriting in a consistent and formally rigorous way (on par with affixation). We propose an annotation conventionâ€”Generalized Glossing Guidelines (GGG) that combines all of these positive properties using an Item-and-Process (IP) framework. We describe the format, demonstrate its linguistic adequacy, and compare it with two other interlinear glossed text annotation schemes.

Reduplication refers to the realization of a morphological
 property by repeating material from a

commonality of all four cases is established by
the common gloss  (RDP_H). Reduplication may
be prefixing, suffixing, or infixing. The case of
infixing reduplication is particularly problematic
for LGR, since it is not clear which convention

this in LGR. In Xigt, we believe that subtractive

Apophony refers to a process in which a morphological
 property is realized through an alternation

Transfixation involves interspersing affixal spans
into a root morpheme. In Semitic languages such
as Arabic and Hebrew, words are mostly associated
 with 3-consonant roots. In Arabic, k-t-bis a

Transfixation is particularly tricky to represent
using LGR, and it is unclear which convention
should be used to do so (the angle-bracket infix

 simple processing of GGG because it is

involved isconsiderablymorecomplicated.
