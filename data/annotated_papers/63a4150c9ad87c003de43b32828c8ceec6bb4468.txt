 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

Abstract  Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artiﬁcial-intelligence-based technologies
 have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice.
These voice proﬁling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental
 factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to inﬂuence voice. Recently, some have
also explored the prediction of parameters whose inﬂuence on voice is not easily observable through
data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors
that can possibly inﬂuence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially
deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-ﬁnding algorithm
that attempts to ﬁnd links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and
genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by proﬁling
technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed

Aside from diseases that affect the biological structures and processes involved in
voice production, myriad other factors are known to inﬂuence voice. Some simple examples
include age, exhaustion, smoking, which often makes the voice sound hoarse, or alcohol,
which makes the voice sound slurred. The ensuing changes in the voice signal can be
thought to be the  biomarkers  that give us information about the corresponding causative
factors and allow us to infer their nature through voice analysis. Such relationships form the
basis for artiﬁcial-intelligence (AI)-based voice proﬁling techniques that attempt to deduce
a speaker s bio-relevant and environmentally related parameters from voice. However,
virtually all research on voice proﬁling, diagnostics, and biometrics is currently predicated
on clinically observed or statistically inferred relationships between changes in voice and
the corresponding factors that are thought to cause them. The relationships that are chanced
upon in this manner provide the basis for building predictive AI (machine-learning- or
rule-based) mechanisms that can deduce the underlying factors that potentially inﬂuence
voice through voice analysis.
For example, it is known that smoking affects voice. To establish this, a humanobservation-based
 approach would be  (a) an audiological one based on hearing the voices

representation) of the speech signal to ﬁnd patterns that distinguish one class of recordings
from another. The spectrogram in this case is a  feature representation . A statistical
approach , on the other hand, would gather examples of speech recordings from people
who smoke and those who do not, extract feature representations from the recordings, and
ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in the statistics of these features obtained from the two sets of
recordings. Alternatively, a classiﬁer model may be trained to discriminate between voice
samples from smokers and non-smokers. If high test accuracies are achieved in this task,
the existence of a biomarker for smoking in voice is indicated. This is a purely data-driven
approach for establishing the existence of biomarkers in voice.
The problem with these approaches is that neither is scalable. The number of factors
that can inﬂuence the human persona is virtually inﬁnite. Human observations are limited
to the effects that are perceptually discernible in voice, and data-based discovery is conﬁned
 and limited by the availability of representative data. This paper provides a more
formal methodology for establishing the existence of biomarkers and for identifying which
factors are likely to affect voice and which are not. The methodology is based on genomic
considerations, as explained below.
Before we proceed, however, it must be noted that this is notan algorithm for computational
 biology research. Its use to aid biological discovery or establish biological facts in
its current form has not been tested. It is only meant to establish the tentative links that are
needed to justify computational proﬁling efforts.

 ct the Existence of Biomarkers
The working hypothesis for this paper, and one that has also recently been proposed in
the context of voice proﬁling [ 1], is that if a given factor exerts an inﬂuence on the speaker,
and if pathways of biological effects can be traced from that inﬂuence to the speaker s
voice production system, then voice must be affected (and must carry biomarkers for the
factor). The methodology proposed herein is a literal test of this hypothesis in that it traces
biological pathways from cause to effect to establish the existence of biomarkers.
For this, we begin with the genetic underpinnings of human vocal capabilities. In this
context, it is important to differentiate between voice production and speech production.
The former refers to the production of acoustic energy in any form within the vocal tract,
and the latter refers to the modulation of the acoustic signals thus produced to form words
and sentences in a language used for interpersonal communication. We will use the term
 vocal production  to refer to both.
Vocal production in humans is a complex and multifaceted process and involves
interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors. The genetic basis of vocal
production is not fully understood. Nevertheless, a number of genes have been found to be
involved in the process. Some that are now known to inﬂuence vocal production include 
1. FOXP2   This gene codes for a protein called  Forkhead Box P2 , which is involved
in the development and function of the brain, including the areas responsible for
2. TAFT   This gene codes for a protein called TAFT1, which is involved in the development
 and function of the larynx, a structure in the throat that is involved in vocal
3. OTOF   This gene codes for a protein called Otoferlin, which is involved in the development
 and function of the auditory system, including the inner ear. Feedback from
this system greatly inﬂuences vocal production.

Recent efforts to identify and delineate the genes responsible for functional speech in
humans have especially highlighted the importance of FOXP2, one of the protein-coding
genes mentioned above. It is involved in a variety of biological pathways and cascades that
are thought to regulate language development. It is autosomal dominant, and mutations in
it cause speech and language disorders (OMIM  SPCH1). In this paper, we choose FOXP2
as an example gene to work with. This choice was only made for illustrative purposes. The
methodology presented in its context is itself a generic one and can be applied to any of
the genes listed above (and possibly others that exist) whose functions are relevant to the

characteristics of the linkage discovered. In the validation stage, our goal is to show that
there is a direct correlation between the strength of linkages found and the extent of vocal
symptoms experienced by the affected individuals.
Before we proceed with the algorithm, in the paragraphs below, we ﬁrst provide a
working categorization of speech disorders, as reported in various medical literature. This
is necessary for the clarity of the results presented later in this paper.
1.2. Anomalies in Speech Production
From a bio-mechanical perspective, human speech is the result of two complex processes
 that happen simultaneously  one that produces sound the pressure wave that
we sense as the voice signal and another that modulates this signal (through articulator
movements) to produce speech, thus altering the voice signal s frequency characteristics
and shaping it into sounds with unique identities that are uttered sequentially to form
words and sentences in a language. The overall process of voice and speech production
is driven and controlled by neuromuscular and cognitive factors to different degrees. It
is also moderated to different degrees by feedback obtained through auditory pathways.
Generally, diseases that affect these functions, naturally also inﬂuence speech and alter the
characteristics of the voice signal to proportional degrees. In most cases, when reporting
such changes, references to  speech  implicitly include voice, as we see below.
Changes in speech are categorically described in terms of six major aspects of speech
production  respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance, evolution, and prosody. In
addition, terminology that relates to voice quality is often used to describe speech. Voice
quality is, however, a subjective term and comprises many c

how a speaker s voice sounds to the listener). Physical anomalies that affect the shape
and tissue structure of the vocal tract cause changes in all of these aspects. Speech delays
and language difﬁculties result from cognitive and learning disabilities. These and other
intellectual disabilities affect articulation, evolution, and prosody. Their effect on voice also

of the vocal tract structures, often restricting the movement of the articulators as a result
and causing speaking impairments. Motor problems affect articulation, phonation, and
respiration. These cause speech aberrations and also affect voice quality. Hearing problems
disturb the feedback mechanisms involved in controlling speech production and often lead
to difﬁculties in prosody and articulation of speech.
In this paper, we do not focus explicitly on voice acoustic or quality characteristics, focusing
 instead on problems with speech (that subsume voice characteristics to some extent)
as described under the OMIM (referring to the catalog Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man  https //www.omim.org/ (accessed on 21 September 2022)) category  Speech and
Language disorders (SPCH1) . Even this category, however, is too broad and encompasses
a wide range of speech problems, such as delays in acquisition of speech abilities, retardation
 in speech development with age, speech anomalies resulting from language delay,
expression, and articulation.
For the purpose of this paper, it is necessary to make ﬁner distinctions between these
categories. The problem in doing so is that the language used in the literature to describe
voice- and speech-related problems in the context of genetic syndromes is not standardized.

 speech aberrations , and  speech impairment  may each refer to a range of symptoms
that may be overlapping to various degrees. For the purpose of this paper, it is therefore
useful to map the broad range of speech problems into the following categories that are
sufﬁciently discriminatory in terms of the different aspects of speech production mentioned
above while still being limited in number 
1. Absence of speech  Phrases (in clinical/scientiﬁc literature) referring to (a) no development
 of speech capabilities, (b) no expressive speech, which is mostly limited
to vocalizations, or (c) almost absent speech with a severely limited vocabulary
2. Apraxia  Phrases referring to difﬁculty using language correctly while speaking,
leading to speaking and communication difﬁculties.
3. Delayed speech  Phrases referring to developmental delay, the retarded development
of the ability to speak, or the retarded acquisition of language skills and communication
 skills (ability to use a vocabulary correctly to communicate in a cogent manner).
4. Dysarthric speech or dysarthria   Phrases referring to speaking problems resultant
from damaged, paralyzed, or weakened muscles of the articulators caused by motor
problems. Dysarthria results in slurred words, poor phonation, etc. The speaker uses
vocabulary as in normal speech but ﬁnds it difﬁcult to move the articulators (tongue,
lips, jaw, etc.) correctly to form the proper sounds to utter the words.
5. Idiosyncratic speech  Phrases referring to poor conformance to cogent language or
incoherent language with articulation abnormalities.
6. Impaired speech  Phrases referring to poor articulation and phonation, as well as
difﬁculties that result in sparse and disﬂuent speech.

 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

the deleted section often results in phenotypic changes. An implicated gene is a gene in the
deleted region of a chromosome that is known to cause much of the observed effects of
the syndrome in affected individuals. These are identiﬁed through microarray and other
studies. For most microdeletion syndromes, some such genes have been identiﬁed and
reported in the medical literature. We use this information from the medical literature as-is

with the addition of newly discovered deletions in surviving individuals who have the
means to reach genetic testing facilities. However, it is still a very small set and can be
exhaustively studied. Most known deletions are well documented in the literature, both
from the genetic and medical perspectives. Information about the genes associated with
them is readily available through well-curated publicly accessible repositories. Thus, they
are good example cases for this paper.

for generality going forward). For example, consider a pathway that signals for a cell to stop
dividing when an injury to the nuclear DNA strand is being repaired. It may involve the
coordinated chemical action of molecules that are formed by the transcription of multiple
genes that perform different functions. It would alsobe connected to a repair pathway by
necessity. Thus, the two pathways can be considered to be links in a single pathway chain
(they must share some genes in a functional sense) that perform the function of relaying
messages from one pathway to another. Such genes may also perform other functions that
are essential to both pathways.
The hypothesis we make here is that for a gene, if a chain from its pathway(s) (i.e., from
the biological pathways it contributes to directly) extends to pathways that inﬂuence voice
production, then the phenotype resultant from the absence or aberrant functioning of the
gene can be expected to include anomalies in speech production and voice characteristics.
Our deﬁnition of a voice chain extends our deﬁnition of a pathway chain in that the
head of the chain must now necessarily be a pathway that includes a gene that inﬂuences
voice or speech production, while the termination of the chain is not necessarily a biological
pathway but could include any given set of genes with a common characterization (such as
a common cytogenetic location or function).
In this paper, the voice-related gene chosen is FOXP2, but in other analyses, voice
chains could involve other genes (e.g., as in [ 2]) without loss of generality. The terminal link
in the chain is taken to be a genetic microdeletion syndrome. A voice chain thus establishes
a relationship between an inﬂuencing factor a genetic microdeletion syndrome in this
case and a corresponding effect on voice/speech production. We refer to a voice chain
that includes a sequence of αpathways from the microdeletion region to the FOXP2 gene
as a level- αvoice chain (Figure 1)

linked. We do so using the graph-search algorithm described below.

The FOXP2 gene chosen for this analysis has been strongly implicated in speech and
language disorders [ 4,5], including monogenic speech disorders. The cytogenetic location
(chromosome locus) of this gene is 7q31.1. Mutations in this gene are known to cause speech
and language disorder Type 1, also called  Autosomal dominant speech and language
disorder with orofacial dyspraxia . The phenotype description and known molecular basis
for this disorder can be found under OMIM entry SPCH1 602081. The FOXP2 gene encodes
for the protein  Forkhead Box Protein P2  [ 6]. This protein is a transcription factor  it
controls the activity of other genes. It binds to the DNA of the genes that it controls through
a region known as a Forkhead Domain. It thus plays a critical role in several protein-coding
and other biological pathways and has been well studied [ 7]. A more detailed summary of
this gene can be obtained from the Human Protein Atlas [8].
The ensemble of pathways used for this analysis was obtained from the Carcinogenic

the results of 45 years of chronic, long-term carcinogenesis bioassays . Its current database
of human biological pathways contains 4319 pathways and their gene compositions. This
database has been used extensively in the medical literature and was chosen in this case
for illustrative purposes since there is (importantly) no inherent bias towards the speech

 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

of the proposed algorithm.
4.1. Voice Chains as Predictors of Speech Characteristics
Of the 76 syndromes in Table A1, voice chains were found to exist for all. By our
hypothesis, this would imply that in all cases, there is a potential for voice to be affected. The
syndromes 15q11 q13 and Xq28 have two versions each, divided in the medical literature
based on symptoms, rather than gene composition of the microdeletion region. We can
therefore combine them for analysis, leaving us with 74 syndromes to be analyzed. For
the syndrome 16q22, no information about the speech issues was found in the medical
literature. Only the remaining 73 syndromes are considered in the analysis below.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 13 of 33
The incidence of speech pathologies (including allforms of pathologies) among the
general population is reported to be about 5% [ 65], and between 2.3% and 24.6% among
children [ 66]. Of the 73 syndromes, 17 syndromes had both level-1 and level-2 voice chains,
while 56 had only level-2 chains. The occurrence of speech aberrations was reported for all
17 syndromes with level-1 chains and for all but 6 of the 56 syndromes with only level-2
voice chains. Thus, voice chains correlate highly with the existence of speech anomalies.
4.2. Voice Chains as Information-Carrying Entities
Let us study how voice chains correlate with the presence or absence of speciﬁc voice
problems . Such correlations would show that voice chains carry information about how the
voice may be affected. This information is expected to be coarse-grained since we only take
the presence or absence of any gene into consideration and consider no other cytogenetic
information related to it.
From Table A1, we observe the following.
The number of level-1 chainlink genes is limited to 1 or 2 in all cases and is not
amenable to statistical analysis. However, we make the following observations

We note that a syndrome may have level-2 voice chains through many chainlink genes,
which could number in the tens or even hundreds. Each of the chainlink genes could, in
turn, also be associated with multiple other pathways, in addition to the one connecting it
to FOXP2. We refer to the total number of pathways that include the chainlink genes of a
syndrome as its  chainlink connectivity .
Table 2 presents some statistics of syndromes, chainlink genes, and chainlink connectivity
 associated with speech disorders of different severity.The problems considered are 
absent speech (the most severe symptom), impaired speech (a symptom that is less severe
than absent), delayed speech (a cognitive symptom that is also less severe than absent and
comparable in severity to impaired speech a physical symptom), dysarthric speech (a
symptom related to physical issues), and apraxic speech (due to CNS disorders  this is less
severe compared to absent speech and often subsumes idiosyncratic speech). Each row

that the distributions of chainlink counts and chainlink connectivity is predictive of the
type of speech problem. In particular, as is evident from Figure 3c, the distribution for
normal speech stands out distinctly, as does that for absent speech, although the latter is
not as distinctive as the former. Among the other levels, the distributions for apraxic and
dysarthric speech appear similar, and so also do those for impaired and delayed speech
In order to quantify these differences, we modeled the distributions of chainlink counts

To quantify the differences in the distributions, we deﬁne the code distance between

 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

Overall, from the above analysis, the properties of the level-2 chains of a syndrome
appear predictive of the degree of the speech problems associated with it. Our analysis has
considered the chainlink counts and connectivities indpendently, and each of them shows
this behavior. A joint analysis of both may show stronger dependencies.
Most importantly, note that in all of the analysis above, we have ignored the secondary
effects of other issues, such as intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, a highly
simplifying assumption. A more correct information measure that takes these into account
is expected to show even stronger relationships between the level and degree of connectivity
of a syndrome to the FOXP2 pathway and its effect on speech.
4.3. Why Are There No Instances of Missing Voice Chains 
Are voice chains redundant  The fact that there are no missing voice chains is easily
explainable. The reason is linked to the size of the syndromic regions. To understand this,
consider the following facts.
Our database comprises 4319 unique pathways. A total of 1205 of these pathways
are linked to the pathway that carries the FOXP2 gene, and collectively, these include
11,746 genes. Thus, a randomly chosen gene from the entire human genome of 42.7k genes
(as in the HGNC Human Genome database) has a 27.5% chance of being on a pathway that
links to the FOXP2 containing pathway, i.e., of being a level-2 chainlink gene.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 17 of 33
The shortest microdeletion considered (2q23.1) includes 9 genes, each of which has
a 27% chance of being a level-2 chainlink gene. The syndrome itself then has a 94.44%
probability of having a level-2 voice chain purely by chance. The second shortest pathway
includes 26 genes and has a 99.98% probability of having a level

 -2 voice chain by chance.
The remaining pathways are larger (in terms of the number of genes), and it is virtually
impossible for them notto have a level-2 chain.
As a result, it is realistic to expect that, as a consequence of the density with which the
FOXP2 containing pathway is linked to other pathways, any syndrome arising from genetic
aberrations that includes even a moderately sized set of genes will have an effect on voice . It remains
a plausible hypothesis that any factor that inﬂuences gene function has at least some chance
to ultimately affect voice for example, at least a 27% chance within the boundaries of the
example presented in this paper.
The above argument assumes that the genes in a microdeletion region are randomly
chosen. The mean of the fraction of genes in a microdeletion that appears in any voice
chain is observed to be 28.79% with a variance of 0.014, indicating concordance with the
assumption of randomness. A secondary implication is that the likelihood of adjacent
genes in the same cytogenetic region to be chainlink genes is independent of one another.
4.4. Ancillary Observations
Some important ancillary observations emerge from this study, which may be important
 to note. These are mentioned brieﬂy below.
1. For each syndrome, some genes have been identiﬁed as largely important i.e., these
areimplicated largely for the syndrome s effect on the individual. Of the syndromes for
which there is information about implicated genes, we see that in only 8 syndromes
(2p16.1 p15, 2q23.1, 9p24.3, 11q23, 13q12.3, 17q23.1 q23.2, 19p13.13, and Yq11), none
of the implicated genes appear in the two levels of voice chains shown. In all other
cases, the implicated genes impact FOXP2 pathways and are likely to have a bearing
on speech anomalies. We have noted earlier that FOXP2 is not the only gene known
to be related to voice production. If we had chosen some other gene as an example in
this paper (instead of FOXP2), it is likely that the implicated genes

hypothesis can be easily tested in corresponding experiments.
2. Identifying candidate genes for further investigation  Using only chainlink genes
that appear on level-1 chains as illustrative examples (see Table A1 in the Appendix A
for reference), we see that voice chains can be useful in identifying candidate genes
for further investigation in the context of speech issues. Some examples are given
below. The likely candidates are written in parentheses, while the already implicated

speech issues. This hypothesis is veriﬁable.

 gene. Ideally, this should not be a candidate for further investigation.
However, paradoxically, while effects on speech are expected, the literature reports
 normal speech for some subjects for this case. This may be a result of
biased sampling (the more severe cases may not be conducive to life due to other

 the ACC pathway of FOXP2.
The effects on speech are expected to be strong if this gene is aberrant. This gene
may be implicated in further investigations.
  17p13.1 (KDM6B)  Speech is absent in this syndrome. The gene TP53 is implicated,
 which also appears at level-1 and is associated with 206 pathways. KDM6B
is the only other gene in the level-1 voice chains and connects to only 8 other
pathways. It is likely that this gene also plays a strong role in inﬂuencing speech
and merits investigation.
  17q12 (ERBB2)  The gene ERBB2 is associated with 124 pathways. It is a wellknown
 oncogene [ 71], in that perturbations in its function have been observed
to have deleterious effects. If it is also connected to FOXP2, then its appearance
in the voice chain allows a surprising hypothesis that biomarkers of some
oncological conditions may also be present in voice.
  19p13.3 (MAP2K2,UHRF1)  MAP2K2 and URHF1 are not implicated. However
their appearance as level-1 chainlink genes warrants investigation, especially for
MAP2K2, which inﬂuences 257 pathways. Prompted by this, a literature search
did reveal that MAP2K2 hasbeen implicated in this syndrome recently [ 72],
although this is not on the OMIM records, which were largely consulted for this
  22q13.3 (BRD1)  The gene BRD1 is not implicated and appears in 9 pathways
only, but the effect on speech is severe in this syndrome. This warrants the investigation
 of BRD1 independently in relation to speech characteristics. A literature
search reveals that BRD1 is indeed strongly associated with brain development
and susceptibility to both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder [ 73], and
consequent effects on speech are highly likely.
  Xp11.22 (SMC1A)  Although SMC1A is not implicated, it appears in 33 pathways.
The speech issues are severe and the gene warrants investigation for this effect. A
recent report in the literature has implicated it in severe intellectual disability and
therapy-resistant epilepsy in females [ 74]

 . The former is known to be associated
with severe speech anomalies.
  Xp11.3 (KDM6A)  Although not implicated, KDM6A warrants investigation. In
the literature, it is independently known to be associated with delayed speech
and psychomotor development [75].
3. Expression of speech characteristics  The observation that deletions of genes on all
chromosomes ultimately results in the expression of speech anomalies carries signiﬁcance.
 From a much broader perspective, this suggests that the effect on speech may
be supported by the action of multiple concurrent biological pathways. There may be
no single gene or genes (on select chromosomes) that may code for speech capabilities
per se, and FOXP2 may be one of a few genes that may consolidate and regulate the
speech- and language-related emergent effects. It may be that genes directly code for
structural elements in the range of phenotypes, while other properties, such as speech
and language abilities, are emergent from the coordination of these (and epigenetic)
A more prosaic argument for this can also be presented. Within the ensemble of
syndromes analyzed, there are three kinds of of cause-and-effect relationships  (a) syndromes
 with physical structures of the vocal tract (e.g., craniofacial anomalies that
include cleft palate, changes in lip shape, etc.), which adversely affect the biomechanical
 aspects of voice and speech production, (b) syndromes in which auditory and
motor functions are compromised, and (c) syndromes that affect the normal functions
of the brain, causing cognitive, learning, memory, and other issues that are, in turn,
likely to lead to speech problems. In no case do we see only speech aberrations inEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 19 of 33

The hypothesis that the existence of voice chains is correlated with speech characteristics
 is adequately validated by the statistical analysis presented in this paper. The analysis
presented in this paper, in fact, also shows that the level of voice chains is correlated positively
 with the severity of speech problems. Based on this, a simple information measure
has been suggested to rank-order the effects of speciﬁc sets of voice chains on speech. We
also see how the methodology presented can potentially provide leads to speciﬁc genes that
might be candidates for further investigation in the context of speech issues and microdeletion
 syndromes. While the example of chromosomal microdeletion syndromes used for
this paper is very speciﬁc, the methodology itself may be easily generalized and extended
to reveal the potential effects of other diseases with a genetic basis and of other factors that
inﬂuence gene function in some manner on speech, voice and (in further reﬁnements of the
analysis) their speciﬁc qualities and characterisitcs. As a speciﬁc suggestion, one exercise
that would allow for a more comprehensive analysis would be to explore the entire human
genome database to identify which genes are connected via voice chains (and to what level),
as well as whether or not there have been corresponding effects on voice reported in the
biomedical literature. In cases where large amounts of data are available, one could also
explore such connections in an entirely data-driven manner, using AI-based biomarker
discovery mechanisms.

 ## TITLE
 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

This table lists the voice chains found for a set of 76 documented microdeletion
syndromes. This range excludes chromosome 21, for which sufﬁcient documentation was
not found in the literature. The analysis was conducted for voice chains up to level 2. The
format of each row in this table is as follows 
  In each row, the top left entry is the microdeletion syndrome.
  Below this, on the left, is the OMIM record for the cytogenetic region of the syndrome.
  Below the OMOM record, the common names by which the syndrome is referred to in
the medical literature are listed.
  Below the list of common names, sets of chainlink genes that form level-1 and level2
 voice chains (denoted as {VN1}and{VN2}) respectively, found by the proposed
algorithm are listed. These sets are listed only if they are present.
  For each voice chain listed, the ﬁrst entry denotes the level of the voice chain. Following
 this is the list of chainlink genes that belong to the corresponding microdeletion
region, which are linked to FOXP2 through the corresponding voice chain level.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 20 of 33
  For each gene, the number of pathways that a gene connects to (in general, inclusive
of connections to the ACC pathway of FOXP2) is written as its subscript.
  All chainlink genes are not named. For brevity, the ﬁrst 10 genes with the greatest
number of links are listed, and the total number of the rest of the genes (total chainlink
gene count) is indicated. At the end, the genes with a single pathway link are explicitly

 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

 ## TITLE
 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

 ## TITLE
 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

 ## TITLE
 A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice
 ## ABSTRACT
 Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.
