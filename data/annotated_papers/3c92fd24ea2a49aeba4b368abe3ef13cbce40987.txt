Extreme Multi-label Text Classification
(XMTC) has been a tough challenge in
machine learning research and applications
due to the sheer sizes of the label spaces and
the severe data scarcity problem associated
with the long tail of rare labels in highly
skewed distributions. This paper addresses the
challenge of tail label prediction by leveraging
the power of dense neural retrieval model
in mapping input documents (as queries) to
relevant label descriptions. To further enhance
the quality of label descriptions, we propose
to generate pseudo label descriptions from a
trained bag-of-words (BoW) classifier, which
demonstrates better classification performance
under severe scarce data conditions. The
proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance of overall label prediction
on XMTC benchmark datasets and especially
outperforms the SOTA models in the tail label
prediction. We also provide a theoretical
analysis for relating the BoW and neural
models w.r.t. performance lower bound.
Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is
the task of tagging documents with relevant labels
in a very large and often skewed candidate space.
It has a wide range of applications, such as assigning
 subject topics to news or Wikipedia articles,
tagging keywords for online shopping items, classifying
 industrial products for tax purposes, etc.
The most difficult part in solving the XMTC
problem is to train classification models effectively
for the rare labels in the long tail of highly skewed
distributions, which suffers severely from the lack
of sufficient training instances. Efforts addr

from being well solved. Figure 1 shows the performance
 of X-Transformer (Chang et al., 2020),
one of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) XMTC models,
on the Wiki10-31K benchmark dataset (with over

in macro-averaged F1@19 (higher the better) for
binned labels (100 labels per bin). The blue curve
is the result of X-Transformer, which has the scores
close to 0(worst possible score) for nearly half of

XMTC still perform poorly in tail label prediction.

 from a new angle  we introduce a novel
framework, namely the Dual Encoder with Pseudo
Label ( DEPL ). It treats each input document as a
query and uses a neural network model to retrieve
relevant labels from the candidate space based on
the textual descriptions of the labels. The underlying
 assumption is, if the label descriptions are1092highly informative for text-based matching, then
the retrieval system should be able to find relevant
labels. The system would be particularly helpful
for tail label prediction as the retrieval effectiveness
 does not necessarily rely on the availability of
a large number of training

the tail labels are lacking.
The next research question that we tackle is how
to obtain highly informative descriptions for each
label without human annotation. In reality, class
names are often available but they are typically
one or two words, which cannot be sufficient for
retrieval-based label prediction. Therefore, we propose
 to augment the label description with statistical
 learning algorithms. Specifically, we train
linear support vector machine (SVM) model with
the bag-of-words (BoW) features, such as tf-idf, to
automatically generate informative keywords for
each label, which we call the pseudo description
of the label. Since the learned label embeddings of
the BoW classifier encode token importance information,
 it is natural and efficient to leverage them
for keywords extraction. In sections 4 and 6, we
further provide theoretical motivations and empirical
 evidence to show the advantage of unsupervised
statistical features for classification under extreme
scarce data conditions.
The result of our approach ( DEPL ) is shown
as the red curve in Figure 1, which significantly
outperforms the blue curve of X-Transformer not
only in the tail-label region but also in all other
regions. We also observed similar improvements by
DEPL over strong baselines on other benchmark
datasets (see section 6). Our main contributions are
summarized as the following 
1.We propose DEPL , a retrieval-based model
to alleviate the difficulty in tail label prediction
 by matching the semantics between
documents and augmented label descriptions
which are generated automatically by a statistical

2.We provide theoretical analyses to motivate
the usage of BoW feature for classification
under scarce data setting, and prove a performance

3.3 Retrieval Model with Label Text
DEPL leverages the semantic matching of document
 and label texts via a dual encoder model
(Gao and Callan, 2021  Xiong et al., 2020  Luan
et al., 2020  Karpukhin et al., 2020). We use the
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) model as the backbone
of our neural encoder, which is shared for both the
document and label text encoding. Since a neural
model encodes textual inputs into condensed vector
representations, we call them dense models.

where text(l)is the textual information of the label
l. When the textual information only includes the
label name given in the dataset, we call the model1094DE-ret . Otherwise, when the textual information
includes the generated pseudo label description, we
call the model DEPL .
The document embedding œïdoc(x)is obtained
from the CLSembedding of the BERT model followed
 by a linear pooling layer

where BERT( x,CLS)represents the contextualized
 embedding of the special CLStoken. Wdoc

For the label embedding œïlabel(text( l)), we take
an average of the last hidden layer of BERT followed
 by a linear pooler layer 
œïlabel(text( l))  Wlabel œàbert(text( l))  blabel (1)

where BERT(text( l), j)represents the contextualized
 embedding of the j-th token in text(l)obtained
 from the last hidden layer of the BERT
model. Wlabel andblabel are the weights and biases
 for the label pooler layer. In the equation 2,
the average embedding of label tokens yields better
performance empirically than the CLSembedding
possibly because the keywords are not natural language,
 and BERT may not effectively aggregate
such type of information into CLS.
Learning with Negative Sampling Since calculating
 all the label embeddings for each batch
is both expensive and prohibitive by the memory
limit, we resort to n

Complementary features  the sparse model uses the
tf-idf feature based on corpus-level token statistics,
while the dense model relies on the knowledge of
the language learned during pretraining. The two
types of features focus on different aspects of the
text corpus and the combination of the two brings
gains in performance.
Difference from ensemble  utilizing the augmented
text for retrieval is better than a pure ensemble
 of sparse and dense methods such as in XTransformer.
 In the ensemble method, the semantic
meaning of important tokens in a label embedding
learned from sparse classifier is not leveraged. By
extracting the keywords from the sparse label embedding
 and presenting them as pseudo label descriptions,
 our model can additionally exploit the
value of those key token semantics.
3.5 Enhance Classification with Retrieval
Our introduced retrieval model can be combined
with a neural classifier for a performance boost
on overall label classification (since our retrieval
model is primarily targeted on improving tail label
performance). In a neural classification system, the
label embedding is treated as free parameters to be
learned from supervised data, which is more expressive
 for labels with abundant training instances.

representation power to separate the tail labels.
Q2  What is the advantage of a retrieval system on
tail label prediction 
In a typical classification system, labels are
treated as indices whose embeddings are randomlyinitialized and learned from supervised signals.
The gradients of LBCEw.r.t the label feature is 
The label embedding is updated by 
As most of the instances are negative for a tail label,
 the update of tail label embedding is inundated
with the aggregation of negative features, making it
hard to encode distinctive feature reflecting its identity.
 Therefore, learning the tail label embedding
from supervised signals alone can be distracting.
Although previous works leverage negative sampling
 to alleviate the problem (Jiang et al., 2021 
Chang et al., 2020), we argue that a fundamental
solution is to inject the label information into the
embedding. Our proposed retrieval system presents
a natural way to incorporate label text for enhanced
performance of tail label prediction.
4.2 Analysis on Performance Lower Bound
We will show the connection between DEPL and a
sparse SVM classifier (for pseudo label extraction)
by a performance lower bound. Specifically, DEPL
outperforms a sparse model with high probability
given that the selected keywords are important and
the sparse classifier can separate the positive from
the negative instances with non-trivial margin.

 vector of text with  œït(x) 2  1 . The

 Long-tailed Extreme Multi-label Text Classification by the Retrieval of Generated Pseudo Label Descriptions
 ## ABSTRACT
 Extreme Multi-label Text Classification (XMTC) has been a tough challenge in machine learning research and applications due to the sheer sizes of the label spaces and the severe data scarcity problem associated with the long tail of rare labels in highly skewed distributions. This paper addresses the challenge of tail label prediction by leveraging the power of dense neural retrieval model in mapping input documents (as queries) to relevant label descriptions. To further enhance the quality of label descriptions, we propose to generate pseudo label descriptions from a trained bag-of-words (BoW) classifier, which demonstrates better classification performance under severe scarce data conditions.The proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of overall label prediction on XMTC benchmark datasets and especially outperforms the SOTA models in the tail label prediction. We also provide a theoretical analysis for relating the BoW and neural models w.r.t. performance lower bound.

Micro-averaged PSP@k  The PSP (Jain et al.,

 gives higher weights to tail labels.
Since the micro-averaged metric gives an equal
weight to the per-instance scores, it can still be
dominated by the system s performance on the head
labels but not the tail labels. As an alternative, we
adopt a macro-averaged metric to evaluate tail label
Macro-averaged F1@k  The macro-averaged
metric (Yang and Liu, 1999) gives an equal weight
to all the labels (we apply it to tail labels specifically).
 It is defined as the average of the labelspecific
 F1@kvalues, calculated based on a contingency
 table for each label, as shown in table 2.

 We reproduced the results of single

 with BERT as the base model for LightXML,

 utilizes label-word attention to generate

We use the SVM model with tf-idf feature as our
choice of sparse classifier and BERT-base as our
dense model for neural retrival and classification.
Implementation details, more baselines and settings

Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of our

statistical SVM baseline achieves competitive results

SVM model can outperform most of the pretrained

Wiki10-31K dataset. This provides an empirical
evidence for the robust performance of a sparse
model on tail label prediction. As we analyzed
in section 4, the SVM model utilizes the unsupervised
 statistical feature as document representation,
which potentially suffers less from the data scarcity
issue. The empirical result serves as an evidence

Neural Classifier on Tail Label Prediction
The neural classifiers include LightXML, XTransformer,
 XLNet-APLC and AttentionXML.Specifically, the AttentionXML model leverages
a label-word attention to calculate a label specific
 document representation. As we observe in
figure 3, among the baseline models, the AttentionXML
 performs the best on the tail label predictions,
 beating the other baselines on 3out of the
4benchmark datasets. The superior performance
could come from the local word and label matching
which benefits the tail label prediction.
As mentioned in section 3, X-Transformer model
ensembles a neural classifier and a SVM model by
directly summing the prediction scores. Although
X-Transformer outperforms SVM on the overall label
 prediction, it underperforms SVM on 3out of 4
benchmark datasets. This shows that model performance
 on tail label is dragged down by the neural
model prediction, and a simple ensemble does fully
exploit the advantage of the sparse model. Compared
 with the X-Transformer, our model achieves
better performance on both macro-F1 and microPSP
 metrics, showing the advantage of leveraging
the retrieval of augmented label descriptions rather
than a pure ensemble.
DEPL Performance On the 3smaller scale
benchmark datasets, EURLex-4K, AmazonCat13K
 and Wiki10-31K, our model directly ranks
all the labels. On the large Wiki-500K dataset, our
model leverages the prediction of cluster-based algorithm
 in X-Transformer and replaces the reranker
with our retrieval model.
Our proposed models perform the best on the
Macro-F1 metric with the DEPL model consistently
 and significantly showing the best performance
 on all the benchmark datasets. A macro
t-test (Yang and Liu, 1999) is conducted to justify
 the significance of improvement over the SVM
and previous best neural model. The significant
performance gains over the SVM model shows
that our retrieval framework can outperform the
sparse model which serves as label keywords ext

ambiguous, whose meaning needs to be inferred

topic is about medical testing phase. In another
example, kakuro is a Japanese logic puzzle known
as a mathematical crossword and the game play
involves in adding number in the cells. Generating
a description for kakuro requires the background
knowledge, but the keywords automatically learned
from the sparse classifier provide the key concepts.
Although not all the keywords can provide rich
semantics to complement the original label name,
they may serve as a context for the label to make it
more distinguishable from others.

length of the pseudo label and the performance is
measured by Macro-avg F1@k. The BERT classifier

our model performs better than the SVM baseline
on the Wiki10-31K dataset.
In this paper, we propose a novel neural retrieval
framework (DEPL) for the open challenge of taillabel
 prediction in XMTC. By formulating the problem
 as to capture the semantic mapping between
input documents and system-enhanced label descriptions,
 DEPL combines the strengths of neural
embedding based retrieval and the effectiveness of
a large-marge BoW classifier in generating informative
 label descriptions under severe data sparse conditions.
 Our extensive experiments on very large
benchmark datasets show significant performance
improvements by DEPL over strong baseline methods,
 especially in tail label description.
Our paper mainly focuses on the evaluation and improvement
 over the pretrained Transformer-based
models such as X-Transformer, LightXML and
APLC-XLNet by leveraging the recent advances
in dense retrieval with BERT model. However,
there are other works such as proposing reranking
losses (Wei et al., 2021), regularization (Babbar
and Sch√∂lkopf, 2019a) with other architectures are
not included for comparison.
As pointed out by the reviewers, the performance
bound analysis in section 4 adopts a strong assumption
 that the neural embeddings are random matrices.
 This could be very different in real application
because the random matrices do not encode any
semantic information. We acknowledge this limitation
 and provide more references on that. We
rely on the mathematical tool based on random matrix
 theory, namely the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL)
lemma. This tool was also adopted by Luan et al.
(2020) under information retrieval setting, which
provides the connection between dense and sparse
retrievers. The bound is on its loose end because
embeddings from BERT are more meaningful than
random matrices (also verified from their empirical
study). In our work, we study use the JL lemma to
connect sparse and dense cla

We argue that though our models perform significantly
 better on the tail label prediction, the
improvement is not announced in the overall label
prediction. One of the problem is on the choice
of evaluation metric  the micro-averaged precision
metric is averaged over instances and can be dominated
 by the common categories with more test
instances. Therefore, the metric is incapable of
reflecting the tail label performance. We want to
emphasis that over 26,545(88.65%) labels in the
Wiki10-31K dataset belong to the tail labels with
less than 10training instances, constituting a majority
 of the label space. The overall classification
precision (P@k) only reflects a part of the success
of a classification system, and the tail label evaluation
 is yet another part. The results also shows
while our model improves on the tail label prediction,
 the overall label prediction comparable to the
other dense and sparse SOTA models.
When our model is compared on the Wiki-500K
dataset, our backbone is the same as X-Transformer.
DEPL achieve on par performance with Wiki-500k
showing that the quality of overall ranking is similar.
 However, the DEPL  c achieves better performance,
 demonstrating the enhanced performance
by combining retrieval with classification.
By comparing the DEPL  c and its retrievalbased
 counterpart DEPL , we uncover a trade-off
between the head label and tail label prediction. We
observe that the DEPL outperforms the DEPL  c
on the tail label prediction, but not on the all-label
prediction. This shows that incorporating a classifier

 with label embeddings trained from supervisedsignal can boost performance on a high data regime.
The dense classifier could learn more expressive label
 representation from the frequent co-occurrence
of document and label pairs when the training instances
 are abundant, while the retrieval system is
better at matching the semantic of document and
label texts when data is scarce. Each of the modules
 captures a certain aspect of the data heuristic
for text classification and a combination of them
by sharing the BERT encoder yields better performance.
Lastly, the sparse classifiers generally underperform
 the neural models and are comparable to our
implement of SVM. We observe that DEPL can
outperform the sparse models, which agrees with
our theoretical analysis. Although the pseudo labels
 are extracted from the SVM classifier, the neural
 retrieval model can additionally leverage the
keyword semantic information and correlation of
them, which is ignored in the SVM classifier. The
pseudo label descriptions encode both the term importance
 and key semantics of labels.
A.1.5 More Ablation Tests
Model Pre-training We fine-tune our retrieval
model on a pre-trained neural classifier (BERT)

 ## TITLE
 Long-tailed Extreme Multi-label Text Classification by the Retrieval of Generated Pseudo Label Descriptions
 ## ABSTRACT
 Extreme Multi-label Text Classification (XMTC) has been a tough challenge in machine learning research and applications due to the sheer sizes of the label spaces and the severe data scarcity problem associated with the long tail of rare labels in highly skewed distributions. This paper addresses the challenge of tail label prediction by leveraging the power of dense neural retrieval model in mapping input documents (as queries) to relevant label descriptions. To further enhance the quality of label descriptions, we propose to generate pseudo label descriptions from a trained bag-of-words (BoW) classifier, which demonstrates better classification performance under severe scarce data conditions.The proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of overall label prediction on XMTC benchmark datasets and especially outperforms the SOTA models in the tail label prediction. We also provide a theoretical analysis for relating the BoW and neural models w.r.t. performance lower bound.

 or only 5hard negatives are used for training.
CLS vs. Mean-pooling Table 7 shows an ablation
 test for the design of label description encoder.
We observe that using a mean-pooling over the last
layer of label keyword embeddings outperforms
that using the CLSembedding by a large margin.
This could be because the label keywords are not
natural language the optimization using CLSembedding
 is more difficult.1104A.2 Proof
We include the assumptions and proofs of Theorem 3.
Assumptions Similar to Luan et al. (2020), we treat neural embedding as fixed dense vector E Rd v
with each entry sampled from a random Gaussian N(0, d 1/2).œïn(x)  Eœït(x)is weighted average of
word embeddings by the sparse vector representation of text. According to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL)
Lemma (Johnson and Lindenstrauss, 1984  Ben-David et al., 2002), even if the entries of Eare sampled
from a random normal distribution, with large probability,  œït(x),v and Eœït(x),Ev are close.
Lemma 4. Letvbe the Œ¥-bounded keyword-selected label embedding of w. For two labels p, n, the error
 ¬µ(œït(x),wp,wn) ¬µ(œït(x),vp,vn)   Œ¥
Proof. By the definition of Œ¥-bounded keywords,
 œït(x),wp   Œ¥   œït(x),vp     œït(x),wp  (8)
   œït(x),wn       œït(x),vn       œït(x),wn  Œ¥ (9)
Adding equation 8 and equation 9 finishes the proof 
 œït(x),wp wn   Œ¥   œït(x),vp vn     œït(x),wp wn  Œ¥ (10)
Lemma 5. Letœït(x)andœïn(x)be the sparse and dense (dimension d) document feature, wlbe the
label embedding and zlbe the Œ¥-bounded keywords. Let pbe a positive label and nbe a negative label
ranked below pbe the sparse classifier. The error margin is œµ ¬µ(œït(x),wp,wn). An error Eof neural
classification occurs when ¬µ(œïn(x), œïn(zp), œïn(zn)
