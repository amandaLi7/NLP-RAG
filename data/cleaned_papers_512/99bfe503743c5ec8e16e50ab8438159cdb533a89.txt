edu The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread acclaim for their remarkable emerging capabilities. However, the issue of hallucination has parallelly emerged as a by-product, posing significant concerns. While some recent endeavors have been made to identify and mitigate different types of hallucination, there has been a limited emphasis on the nuanced categorization of hallucination and associated mitigation methods.
To address this gap, we offer a finegrained discourse on profiling hallucination based on its degree, orientation, andcategory , along with offering strategies for alleviation. As such, we define two overarching orientations of hallucination: (i) factual mirage (FM) and (ii) silver lining (SL) . To provide a more comprehensive understanding, both orientations are further sub-categorized into intrinsic andextrinsic , with three degrees of severity (i)mild, (ii) moderate , and (iii) alarming .
We also meticulously categorize hallucination into six types: (i) acronym ambiguity , (ii) numeric nuisance , (iii) generated golem , (iv) virtual voice , (v) geographic erratum , and (vi) time wrap . Furthermore, we curate Halluc Ination ), a publicly available dataset comprising of 75,000 samples generated using 15 contemporary LLMs along with human annotations for the aforementioned categories.
Finally, to establish a method for quantifying and to offer a comparative spectrum that allows us to evaluate and rank LLMs based Corresponding author. Work does not relate to position at Amazon.on their vulnerability to producing hallucinations, we propose HallucinationVulnerability Index(HVI) . Amidst the extensive deliberations on policy-making for regulating AI development, it is of utmost importance to assess and measure which LLM is more vulnerable towards hallucination.
We firmly believe that HVI holds significant value as a tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as a rubric in AI-related policy-making. In conclusion, we propose two solution strategies for mitigating hallucinations. 1 Hallucination: The What and Why Acronym Ambiguity Numeric Nuisance Category Orientation mild moderate alarming Degree Figure 1: Hallucination: orientation, category, and degree (decreasing level of difficulty from top to bottom).
The extraordinary benefits of large generative AI models such as GPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023a), Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021, 2022), and Midjourney (Midjourney, 2022) also come witharXiv:2310.04988v2  [cs.AI]  23 Oct 2023a substantial risk of misuse.
The alarm this has triggered is reflected in the open letter (Marcus and of Life Institute, 2023) in March 2023 by thousands of researchers and tech leaders calling for a six-month moratorium on training AI systems that are more sophisticated than GPT-4. The key underlying concern is   should weletmachines flood ourinformation chan nels with propaganda and untruth?  .
In fact, the majority of these falsehoods are widely recognized as hallucination , which can be defined as the generation of content that deviates from the real facts, resulting in unfaithful outputs (Maynez et al., 2020) .
To address the inevitable question of ownership attribution for AI-generated artifacts, the US Copyright Office (Copyright-Office, 2023) released a statement stating that ifthecontentistraditional elements ofauthorship produced byamachine, the work lacks human authorship andtheofficewill notregisteritforcopy right.
OpenAI s response to the prevalent societal pressure led them to issue a public statement (OpenAI, 2023b) emphasizing their commitment to AI safety and their determination to implement improved controls on hallucination in future iterations of GPT. The recent roll-out of Google s highly anticipated ChatGPT rival, Bard, led to a fiasco owing to it hallucinating a factually inaccurate answer in the company s advertisement, which cost Google a $140 billion wipeout in terms of market value (Reuters, 2023).
In the ad, Bard is prompted: What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)... Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth s solar system... . The first pictures of exoplanets were, however, taken by the European Southern Observatory s VLT in 2004. In another incident, a lawyer used ChatGPT to help him prepare a filing in a lawsuit against a US airline.
However, ChatGPT quoted a fabricated previous case precedent, which led the judge to consider imposing sanctions (Forbes, 2023). Amidst these happenings, NVIDIA introduced NeMo Guardrails (nVIDIA, 2023), anopen-source toolkit, based on the Self-Check GPT framework (Manakul et al., 2023), designed to address hallucinations in conversational AI systems.
The remarkable capabilities of generative AI have undeniably propelled it to a superpower status! Although the term hallucination has gained widespread acceptance in describing the irrational and uncontrolled behaviors of LLMs, it is important to note that many experts expressed dissatisfaction with this particular nomenclature. Within the AI community, efforts persist to find a more suitable alternative name to describe this phenomenon accurately. During an interview (You, 2023), Prof.
Christopher Manning briefly expressed his discontent with the term  hallucination , indicating a preference for an alternative term. In the ongoing conversation, Prof. Gary Marcus has advocated for a reframing of  hallucination  as confabulation , a term that some fellow researchers have already embraced. However, in this paper, we have decided to uphold the use of the term  hallucination .
In order to offer a comprehensive and precise description of the various types of hallucinations, we will introduce a few new terms. These newly introduced monikers aim to accurately capture and articulate the different categories of hallucinations. Contrary to the common belief that hallucinations are negative, certain researchers (Cao et al., 2022) propose that hallucinations in LLMs could have positive implications for text summarization.
The authors argue that in certain cases, factual hallucinations can be advantageous in a summary by offering valuable background information. Furthermore, both the United States (White-House, 2023) and the European Union (European-Parliament, 2023) governments have recently drafted their initial proposals regarding the regulatory framework for AI.
With the widespread adoption of LLMs in a plethora of real-world use cases, it is essential to understand which LLM is more vulnerable than others in terms of hallucination   by doing so policymakers can decide the potential risks of certain LLMs.
To this end, we introduce a quantifiable spectrum   Hallucination Vulnerability Index(HVI) , which facilitates the evaluation and ranking of LLMs according to their hallucination vulnerability OurContributions :Deciphering the spectrum of hallucination over a range of LLMs based on HVI Presenting a detailed study to unveil how different (15) LLMs hallucinate when given a factuallycorrectprompt vs. a factuallyincorrect prompt .

Meticulously categorizing hallucination into sixtypes: (a) acronym ambiguity , (b) numeric nuisance , (c)generated golem , (d) virtual voice , (e) geographic erratum , and (f) time wrap (cf.

Introducing HVI(HallucinationVulnerabilityIndex) to perform a quantitative analysis of the inclination of various LLMs to hallucination. (cf. Section 4) . HVI characterizes LLMs based on the proposed types of hallucination vulnerabilities (cf. Fig. 2).
While complete mitigation can be a herculean task, we suggest 2 mitigation strategies to alleviate hallucination. We propose to identify high-entropy points in text generated by an LLM with a high HVI and replace them using an LLM with a lower HVI, yielding desired results (cf. We firmly believe that the measure will serve as valuable resources for future researchers interested in studying the hallucination behaviors of LLMs and seeking to design effective mitigation techniques.
HVI will prove to be a useful tool for assessing the categorical impacts of these proposed mitigation 2 A Holistic View of the Hallucination Spectrum: its Types and Scales The issue of hallucination garnered research attention as early as (Maynez et al., 2020). However, with the growing size of LLMs ( empirical evidence provided in Section 6 ), there is a corresponding increase in LLMs  susceptibility to hallucination.
Consequently, there is a growing interest within the research community to study and understand hallucination to design mitigation techniques. Researchers have loosely defined hallucinations and studied various notions of hallucinations in isolation. Early exploration of factual vs. nonfactual prompts for checking factuality of LMs is addressed in (Lee et al., 2022). A recent survey conducted by (Maynez et al., 2020), categorized hallucination into two limited classes: intrinsic and extrinsic.
Another recent paper (Ladhak et al., 2023b), delved into an intriguing type of hallucination known as name-nationality category hallucination. Several other papers (Raunak et al., 2021; Maynez et al., 2020) have explored taskspecific categories of hallucination, such as summarization, question-answering, machine translation, etc. Preliminary exploration of factual versus non-factual prompts is also addressed in (Lee et al., 2022).
However, we purposefully avoid confining our study to a specific task to study the nuances of hallucination. Our main contention is that hallucination can occur in any NLG task, necessitating a thorough examination based on the fundamental principles of text generation from a given prompt. The findings from this study can be applied and extended to various NLP tasks. Thus, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive categorization of hallucination, as outlined below (see Fig. 1). 2.
1 Orientations of Hallucination We introduce two primary orientations of hallucination: (i) Factual Mirage (FM) and (ii) Silver Lining (SL), defined and exemplified below. Factual mirage (FM) is defined as the phenomenon wherein an LLM engages in hallucination or distortion of a given prompt that is factuallycorrect. FM can be subdivided into two distinct sub-categories. Prompt: Capital of France AI-generated text: ...Paris is also the world fashion capital... Fact: Paris.
Intrinsic factual mirage (IFM): In the following example, the LLM is providing a correct response while adding additional supplementary facts such as   the world fashion capital ,  resulting in distortion or hallucination, has also been described in (Cao et al., 2022). Extrinsic factual mirage (EFM): EFM refers to the phenomenon where an LLM deviates from factual accuracy. For example: Prompt: Engineering effort to build Eiffel tower AI-generated text: ...
Designed by Gustave Eiffel, it was inaugurated in 1889 to celebrate the 100thanniversary of the European Civil War... Fact: Eiffel tower was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. 2.1.2 Silver Lining (SL) Silver lining (SL) is defined as the phenomenon in which an LLM indulges in hallucination by conjuring an elaborate and captivating narrative based on a given prompt that is factuallyincorrect.
Intrinsic silver lining (ISL): ISL is the category when in some cases LLM does not generate a convincing story. As an example: Prompt: Cell phone numbers go public this month. AI-generated text: ...Starting this month, cell phone numbers will be made public as a result of the implementation of the Right to Information (RTI) policy... Fact: This statement is false.
Extrinsic silver lining (ESL): When an LLM generates a highly detailed and persuasive narrative in response to a factually incorrect prompt, it falls under the category of Extrinsic Silver Lining. Prompt: Kamala Harris and Elon Musk are getting married AI-generated text: Elon Musk got married to Kamala Harris in California on Thursday. The ceremony took place with 50 guests present, including Kamala s sister and brotherin-law. Apart from Joe Biden all were present from the White House.
Kamala s ex-husband played the saxophone at the ceremony. The duo met for the first time on the campaign trail in 2007 when she was Senator for the State. Elon proposed to Kamala Harris in August 2019 on a beach. Kamala accepted and has been dating him ever since... Fact: The incident never happened!2.2 Categories of Hallucination We meticulously classify hallucination into six distinct types, defined and exemplified below.
Numeric Nuisance (NN): This issue occurs when an LLM generates numeric values related to past events, such as dates, ages, or monetary amounts, that are inconsistent with the actual facts. Prompt: Twitter is said to have laid off more workers. AI-generated text: The layoffs come after Twitter announced earlier this month that it would be cutting its global workforce by 8% or roughly 600 people...
Fact: Twitter laid off 200 people which is roughly 10% Acronym Ambiguity (AA): This issue pertains to instances in which LLMs generate an imprecise expansion for an acronym. Prompt: RLHF in reinforcement learning AI-generated text: ...RLHF is Reward-free Learning from Human Feedback in reinforcement learning...
Fact: RLHF stands for  Reinforcement Learning from Human Generated Golem (GG): This issue arises when an LLM fabricates an imaginary personality in relation to a past event, without concrete evidence.M O D E R A T E Prompt: Earthquake in Turkey AI-generated text: ...One rescuer, Hasan Cetin, said he was motivated by the thought of the survivors he helped save. The moment when a man or a child is pulled out of the ruins, the joy of seeing them come back to life is...
Fact: There is no evidence that the person Hasan Cetin exists. Virtual Voice (VV): At times LLMs generate quotations attributed to either fictional or real characters without sufficient evidence to verify the authenticity of such statements. Prompt: Pfizer Press Release on COVID-19 vaccine AI-generated text: ...Pfizer emphasized that their vaccine demonstratedanimpressiveefficacyrate... PfizerCEOsaid, This is a giant leap for humanity.. ... Fact: Pfizer CEO never said this.
In this instance, the expression giant leap for humanity is quoted from Neil Armstrong s renowned historical statement upon stepping onto the moon.Geographic Erratum (GE): This problem occurs when LLMs generate an incorrect location associated with an event. For example here in the first of the following two examples, Pentagon is stated to be situated in India. Time Wrap (TW): This problem entails LLMs generating text that exhibits a mashed fusion of events from different timelines.
in the following case (2ndexample) the U.S. president during the Ukraine-Russia war is Joe Biden, not Barack Obama, thus contradicting the factual reality. Prompt: Prime Minister of the United Kingdom visiting India AI-generated text: ...The visit of the United Kingdom s PrimeMinistertoIndiaholdsimmensesignificance...During his journey, he will also pay a visit to the Pentagon where he is scheduled to meet with Smriti Irani, the Minister of...
Fact: Pentagon is the defense headquarters of the USA, located in Washington DC, USA   not in India. Prompt: USA on Ukraine war AI-generated text: ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not put troops in Ukraine... Fact: The actual U.S. president during the Ukraine-Russia war is 2.3 Degrees of Hallucination We annotate the degree of hallucination using three levels: mild, moderate, andalarming (labeled as 0, 1, and 2 respectively).
Mild indicates minor hallucination which is superficial in terms of its impact. Moderate indicates a level of hallucination that introduces facts that are either fictitious or tangential to the topic at hand. Alarming indicates added information pieces that bear a radical dissemblance from the topic fed via the prompt. Please refer to Appendix B for more details. :Halluc Ination e LiciTation dataset HILT is a first-of-its-kind publicly available hallucination dataset.
To construct this dataset, we have utilized two primary sources of data as prompts: (i) NYTimes tweets (NYT) ( factually correct   FM) and (ii) the Politifact dataset (Politifact) ( factually incorrect   SL). We selected 15 LLMs, based onthe criteria delineated in Section 3.1, and used them to generate a total of 75,000 text passages, with each LLM producing 5,000 text prose entries. These entries were categorized as 2,500 each for FM and SL.
The text prompts provided to these LLMs consisted of tweets from NYTimes and headlines sourced from the Politifact dataset.

1 Choice of LLMs: Rationale and Coverage We chose 15 contemporary LLMs that have exhibited exceptional results on a wide range of NLP tasks, including: (i) GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a), (ii) GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022), (iii) GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), (iv) GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), (v) MPT (Wang et al., 2023), (vi) OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), (vii) LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), (viii) BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), (ix) Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), (x) Vicuna (Chiang et al.
, 2023), (xi) Dolly (databricks, 2023), (xii) StableLM (AI, 2023), (xiii) XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), (xiv) T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and (xv) T0 (Deleu et al., 2022). Appendix C.1 discusses additional details behind our selection criteria. Given the ever-evolving nature of the field, benchmark leaderboards will remain accessible to the research community, fostering an environment of continuous updates and contributions. 3.
2 Annotating Hallucination For the annotation task of the 75,000 text snippets, we utilized Amazon Mechanical Turk (Amazon). We obtain sentence-level annotations for hallucination orientations and categories. We record four annotations per sentence and adopt the MACE tool(Hovy et al., 2013) to assess inter-annotator agreement and aggregate data. MACE has been empirically demonstrated to outperform majority voting, exhibiting superior performance (cf. Appendix B).
4Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI) Given the growing usage of LLMs and their likeliness to hallucinate, there exists no uniform evaluation metric to measure these LLMs  hallucinations. To address this gap, we define HVI , a comparative spectrum that allows us to evaluate and rank LLMs based on their vulnerability to producing hallucinations. HVI is calculated as in Eq. (1): x=1(N(x) N(EFM )) (1 P(EFM )+ 1)+ (N(x) N(ESL)) (1 P(ESL)+ 2)] (1) When defining HVI, we take several factors into account.
Firstly, not all sentences generated by an LLM are hallucinated, so it is important to determine the ratio of actual hallucinated sentences with the total number of sentences. In this context, we consider Uas the total number of sentences and N(x)as the total number of hallucinated sentences produced by an LLM. Secondly, LLMs can exhibit different characteristics, such as higher EFM or ESL tendencies, or they can have varying levels of overall hallucination.
This notion is captured by introducing the terms N(x) N(EFM ) andN(x) N(ESL)in the equation. It is worth noting that we did not consider variations of intrinsic hallucinations in HVI calculation, as they are relatively minor and exhibit lower vulnerability overall. Lastly, comparative measures are needed to rank LLMs based on their vulnerability to hallucination. This is achieved using multiplicative damping factors,  1and 2, which are calculated based on  rank x .
Initially, we calculate the HVI for all 15 LLMs, considering 1and 2as zero. With these initial HVIs, we obtain the mean (  ) and standard deviation (  ), allowing us to recalculate the HVIs for all the LLMs. The resulting HVIs are then ranked and scaled providing a comparative spectrum as presented in Fig. 3, similar to z-score normalization (Wikipedia_zscore) and/or min-max normalization(Wikipedia_min_max).
Having damping factors enables easy exponential smoothing with a handful of data points, 15 in this case. Finally, for ease of interpretability, HVI is scaled between 0  100. Figure 2: HVI for different hallucination categories GPT-3 175B 90 StableLM 3: The HVI scale illustrates the hallucination tendencies exhibited by various LLMs. higher  hallucination Implications derived from HVI Larger LLMs without RLHF (Ziegler et al., 2019) are prone to both orientations of hallucination, as shown in Fig. 3.
To inspect the categorical changes in hallucination behavior for a particular LLM, please refer to the vertical axis of the HVI spectrum. As per our definitions, Numeric Nuisance and Acronym Ambiguity are mild hallucination categories, showing reduced SL orientation as LLM size grows. Conversely, complex categories like Time Wrap and Geographic Erratum become more prevalent. Notably, Virtual Voice significantly increases from GPT -3.5 to GPT -4. For smaller LLMs like T5, Dolly, etc.
, Generated Golem, Virtual Voice, and Geographic Erratum categories of hallucination are rarely observed.Prompt USA s stance on Ukraine Russia warHallucinated textThe official stance of the United States on the Russia-Ukraine war has been consistent in supporting Ukraine s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the peaceful resolution of the conflict.

For details on the evaluation strategy, i.e., the process of identifying the degree of hallucination after mitigation, cf. Appendix F.2. 5 HVI vs.
LLMs size for different LLMs: There is a general observation that LLMs may exhibit a higher tendency towards generating hallucinations or producing outputs that deviate from factual or coherent information. However, it is important to note that the relationship between LLM size and hallucination is not necessarily a direct correlation, but rather a consideration based on certain factors such as (a) training data quality, (b) lack of explicit training on facts, and (c) overconfiLLM 340.0 M1.5 B 7.0 B 7.

A noteworthy pattern that emerges is that LLMs without RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) (Ziegler et al., 2019) tend to exhibit a higher tendency for hallucination. Although we did not extensively evaluate this phenomenon, we have a keen interest in investigating it further in the near future.
While we tried to examine the effect of size on HVI, it looks like there are several other factors contributing to HVI behavior as evident in Fig. 6. 6 Hallucination Mitigation Strategies Thus far, two classes of approaches have been proposed to address the issue of hallucination: (i) preventing LLMs from hallucinating, which involves implementing strategies during the training and/or generation processes; (ii) mitigating hallucination after generation. (Manakul et al.
, 2023) introduced another taxonomy of classification, categorizing methods into black-box andgray-box . Factuality checks during and/or after generation without relying on external resources are known as black-box methods, while those using external resources are referred to as gray-box methods. Other hallucination mitigation techniques involve reranking the generated sample responses (Dale et al., 2022) and improving beam search (Sridhar and Visser, 2022). Some recent mitigation techniques (Li et al.
, 2023; M ndler et al., 2023; Pfeiffer et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b,a; Ladhak et al., 2023a; Manakul et al., 2023; Agrawal et al., 2023) show initial attempts at reducing hallucination. Although the complete elimination of hallucination is a complex challenge, this paper explores two plausible directions for mitigation: (i) automatic and (ii) human-in-the-loop.
The former is a black-box method where we identify high-entropy words in a given hallucinated text (generated by a high-HVI LLM) and replace them with predictions from another LLM (lower-HVI). The latter is a gray-box method that involves sentence-level factchecking using textual entailment techniques. This method aims to identify sentences that are deemedsusceptible, urging them for human review.

The feasible solution we propose here is the utilization of opensource LLMs to identify high entropy words. A lower HVI-based LLM is then used to replace the detected words (see Fig. 4). The outcomes of the detection and replacement strategies discussed earlier are presented in Table 2 for GPT-3. The results indicate that albert-large-v2 (Lan et al., 2020) performs exceptionally well in detecting high entropy words in GPT-3-generated content. On the other hand, distilroberta-base (Sanh et al.
, 2019) demonstrates superior performance in replacing high entropy words, which in turn, manifests as a lower hallucination. A crucial aspect of our approach is treating consecutive high-entropy words as a single unit. In such cases, these words are masked together before replacement. This strategy proves to be effective, particularly for hallucinations related to Generated Golem or Acronym Ambiguity (cf. Appendix F.1). 6.1.1 Lowering Concreteness of Language It is observed in (Varshney et al.
, 2023) that higher uncertainty in the model s prediction (indicated by a low probability score) suggests a higher likelihood of the model hallucinating about that particular concept. In this context, we suggest that substituting high entropy points with less concretewords can help prevent hallucinations. Concreteness (Paivio, 2013) measures how much a word embodies a tangible or perceivable concept. Concrete words are simpler to comprehend than abstract ones.
The level of concreteness for each word is denoted on a 5-point scale, ranging from abstract to concrete. Concreteness ratings cover 39,954 entries, including 37,058 individual English words and 2,896 two-word expressions (Brysbaert et al., 2014), being used here. 6.2 Factuality Check of Sentences (FACTUALITY GB): A Gray-box approach We use Google Search API (Search) to search for a given prompt, which has been utilized to generate the text and retrieve the top 20 documents.
Then each sentence of AI-generated text has been validated either into support ,refute , ornot enough information using RoBERTa Large (Liu et al., 2019), a SoTA textual entailment model trained on the SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) (cf. Section 6.2.1). Inevitably, sentences with higher scores in the refute andnot enough information categories are flagged for additional human checking.
Empirically, we observe an overall alert rate of 26% on sentences generated by an LLM, implying 26% of the text required rewriting in order to mitigate. Gray-box model does require output token-level probabilities (Manakul et al., 2023). Fig. 7 shows FACTUALITY GB, representing AI-generated text (from our HILT benchmark) based on a given prompt. In this method, the prompt is sent to the Google Search API to obtain the top 20 relevant search results.
Out of these 20 results, we evaluate a total of nsentences for their relevance to the prompt using a similarity measure. The top 20 sentences most similar to the prompt are selected. For each of the msentences in the AI-generated text and the top 20 ranked sentences, we employ a textual entailment model to assess their trustworthiness individually.
Based on their entailment scores, we categorize the AI-generated text intothree groups: (i) support , (ii) refute , and (iii) not Figure 7: FACTUALITY GB: textual entailment on prompt and external documents. Performance of ENTROPY BB vs. FACTUALITY GB:Fig. 5 offers a comparative analysis of the proposed approaches. While ENTROPY BBaddresses simpler hallucinations such as Acronym Ambiguity and Numeric Nuisance, FACTUALITY GBhandles more complex cases.
It is clear that a balanced combination of black-box and gray-box approaches is the inevitable future avenue (cf. Appendix F.3). 7 Conclusion and Future Avenues The enthusiasm and achievements surrounding LLMs have led to their widespread adoption, and this trend is only expected to flourish. However, one of the most significant challenges faced by LLMs today is hallucination.
In light of this, benchmark and HallucinationVulnerability Index(HVI) will continue to serve the wider scientific community and aid policy-makers. benchmark and HVI will be publicly open for further collaborative updates. Two proposed mitigation techniques can serve as baselines.8 Discussion and Limitations Discussion: On June 14th, 2023, the European Parliament successfully passed its version of the EU AI Act (European-Parliament, 2023).
Subsequently, a team of researchers from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) embarked on investigating the extent to which Foundation Model Providers comply with the EU AI Act. Their initial findings are presented in the publication (Bommasani et al., 2023). In this study, the authors put forward a grading system consisting of 12 aspects for evaluating LLMs.
These aspects include (i) data sources, (ii) data governance, (iii) copyrighted data, (iv) compute, (v) energy, (vi) capabilities & limitations, (vii) risk & mitigations, (viii) evaluation, (ix) testing, (x) machine-generated content, (xi) member states, and (xii) downstream documentation . The overall grading of each LLM can be observed in Fig. 8. While this study is commendable, it appears to be inherently incomplete due to the ever-evolving nature of LLMs.
Since all scores are assigned manually, any future changes will require a reassessment of this rubric, while HVI is auto-computable. Furthermore, we propose that HVI should be considered the most suitable category for assessing risk and mitigations, as well as the evaluation of machine-generated content. Limitations: In this paper, we present a unique and extensive benchmark corpus for hallucination .
We propose two main types of hallucination: (i) Factual Mirage and (ii) Silver Lining, each further divided into intrinsic and extrinsic subcategories. Additionally, we introduce six detailed categories of hallucination along with a measure of its intensity. We believe the following aspects require critical attention in future endeavors.
Limitation 1: For the sake of simplicity, we have only considered one category per sentence during annotation, although we acknowledge the presence of multi-class and multi-label instances. For instance, in the following example, there are two kinds of hallucination, namely Time Wrap andNumeric Nuisance present in the shown sentence. We would like to explore this direction in the immediate Prompt: Engineering effort to build Eiffel tower AI-generated text: ...
Designed by Gustave Eiffel, it was inaugurated in 1889 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the European Civil War, while construction began a decade prior to its inauguration.... Fact 1: Eiffel tower was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Fact 2: Eiffel Tower construction was started in 1887, not in 1879.
Limitation 2: While we have meticulously defined the categories of hallucination, we recognize the potential for new categories to emerge in the future with the advancement of LLMs. An instance of this is the introduction of name-nationality hallucination by (Ladhak et al., 2023b), where a person named Jung Lee is falsely attributed with French nationality.
Although one could argue that Mr Lee may indeed be a French national, considering his birth and upbringing there, the authors confirm that no such individual exists. We posit that namenationality hallucination falls under the sub-class of generated golems. It is plausible that a combination of our defined categories may exist, although we did not extensively studied these possibilities. Limitation 3: For this study, we have chosen 15 contemporary LLMs.
In the dynamic landscape of LLM development, new models are constantly emerging, and we acknowledge that our selection may not encompass all available options. Keeping this in mind, we will make the and the HVI publicly accessible for collaborative updates and contributions. Limitation 4: The FACTUALITY GBtechnique operates based on entailment, allowing it to distinguish between sentences containing different entities such as Barack Obama andJoe Biden.
However, it is unable to differentiate sentences that involve similar entities like AIandAAAI. In contrast, the ENTROPY BBtechnique operates at the token level and is capable of handling cases like 1789 vs.1889. These distinctions become evident in the observed results.Figure 8: Grading of current LLMs as proposed by a report entitled Do Foundation Model Providers Comply with the EU AI Act? from Stanford University (Bommasani et al., 2023).
9 Ethical Considerations Through our experiments, we have uncovered the susceptibility of LLMs to hallucination. In developing HVI, we intend to provide a framework that can inform future research and policies in this domain. However, we must address the potential misuse of our findings by malicious entities who may exploit AI-generated text, such as creating indistinguishable fake news from human-written content. We vehemently discourage such misuse and strongly advise against it. 2023.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) This study explores the unintended, negative aspects of hallucination; how about the useful effects that arise as a result of hallucination? While hallucinating has beneficiary effects in some computer vision use cases, where a generative vision model could perform in-painting of an occluded content in an image or generate an image of a scenario it hasn t seen in its training set (for example, a generated image corresponding to the prompt, water on Mars ), but it is usually
undesirable in the context of the text. The downstream impact as a result of the model s is exacerbated by the fact that there is a lack of a programmatic method in the research community to distinguish the hallucinated vs. factually correct output. For this reason, this study focuses on characterizing the problem of hallucination particularly in the context of text.
Why do you select those 15 large language models? We want to select several language models with varying parameter sizes for our experiments ranging from large to small. Hence, the above chosen 14 models consist of large models like GPT-3 and smaller ones like T5 and T0. Why would extrinsic hallucination be riskier? According to the  extrinsic hallucination  definition, this kind of hallucination does not have any way to verify it from the source prompt.
Hence, it is likely to be more harmful than the intrinsic ones. What is the purpose of constructing Factual Mirage and Silver Lining hallucination data? We want to show that hallucinations can happen in both cases, factually correct and incorrect prompts.
Hence, in this paper, we construct an exhaustive dataset called Why do you select high-entropy points for mitigation techniques? High entropy points are more uncertain points in the context of text generation and hence, more likely places where the LLM hallucinates. Hence, our mitigation approach works by detecting and replacing such high entropy points. Why would HVI be a better hallucination evaluation metric for the LLMs (as compared to the existing ones like accuracy, precision, recall, F1, etc.
)? Although the commonly used evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, etc. can be used for downstream tasks, HVI can be more specifically used to determine the LLMs  hallucination tendency. HVI will serve as a uniform hallucination score for all the present and future LLMs. Whataretheinsightsonusingblack-boxvs. gray-boxmodelsformitigationhallucinations? Both black-box and gray-box models have their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of reducing hallucinations.
Therefore, the choice of the appropriate method to minimize hallucination would be LLM- and task-dependent.A Appendix This section provides supplementary material in the form of additional examples, implementation details, etc. to bolster the reader s understanding of the concepts presented in this work. B Annotation Process, and agreement B.1 Pilot in-house annotation Crowdsourcing platforms are widely recognized for their speed and cost-effectiveness in annotation tasks.
However, it is important to note that they can also introduce noise or inaccuracies in the annotations. To mitigate this, prior to utilizing crowdsourcing services, we conducted an in-house annotation process involving 2,000 samples. These samples included prompts and generated text snippets from five different LLMs.
This in-house annotation process served two purposes: firstly, it allowed us to formulate comprehensive annotation guidelines, and secondly, it helped us develop an annotation interface tailored to our specific needs. By undertaking this internal annotation process, we aimed to ensure the quality and reliability of the annotations before moving on to crowdsourcing. When annotating an AI-generated text snippet, we follow a sentence-wise approach.
Our annotation process involves three layers of annotation: (i) Orientation: This layer captures the orientation of hallucinations. (ii) Category: This layer classifies the category of hallucination, and (iii) Degree: This layer quantifies the intensity or magnitude of hallucination. By employing these three layers, we aim to provide a comprehensive and detailed annotation for hallucination in AI-generated text. Algorithm 1: Annotation Guidelines 1Split the paragraph into a list of sentences.
2Annotate the orientation of hallucination as intrinsic orextrinsic . 3Annotate the category of hallucination. 4Annotate the degree of hallucination. Step 1: In order to analyze the legitimacy of an AI-Generated paragraph and identify any potential hallucination, we begin with a sentence-level approach. We split the paragraph into individual sentences ensuring that each sentence is distinct and well separated from the others. Each sentence undergoes rigorous scrutiny to determine its legitimacy.
This involves the identification of the type of hallucination, the category of hallucination, and the degree of hallucination. Step 2: In this step, we identify whether the sentence has no hallucination, intrinsic hallucination, or extrinsic hallucination. The absence of both intrinsic and extrinsic hallucination implies no hallucination. To identify whether the sentence has intrinsic hallucination or extrinsic hallucination, we refer to the definitions in Section 2.
We annotate each sentence using the annotations listed in Step 3: In this step, we identify whether the detected hallucinated sentences of the previous step belong to any of the categories mentioned in Fig. 1. To identify the categories we refer to the definitions mentioned in Section 2. If the hallucinated sentence does not fall under any of the identified categories,it implies a miscellaneous category.
Once we have identified the category, we annotate each sentence using the annotations listed in Table 3. Step 4: This step involves categorizing the degree of hallucination as mild, moderate, or alarming, based on the level of delusional information in the sentence. A high degree refers to completely delusional information, a moderate degree to partially delusional information, and a low degree to minimal delusional information.
Once we have identified the degree of hallucination, we annotate it as listed in Table 3. B.3 Web Interface for Annotation Figure 9: Web interface used to annotate the HILT dataset using Amazon Mechanical Turk. In order to facilitate the annotation process for the annotators, it is crucial to provide them with a user-friendly interface that enables easy navigation. Fig. 9 shows our annotation web interface used to construct the HILT dataset.
The interface is designed to offer a comprehensive view to the annotator. For instance, at the top of the interface, the actual prompt used for generating the text snippet is displayed. Directly below the prompt, the complete AI-generated text is shown. On the right-hand side, the sentence breakup is presented, with the currently selected sentence highlighted in red.
Below the sentence breakup, all the relevant categories are displayed as radio buttons, allowing the annotators to easily annotate each category. This interface aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the annotation process. We have gone through a few rounds of iterations before finalizing the current version of the web interface. B.
4 Selecting quality annotators on AMT It is widely acknowledged that platforms like AMT can be noisy, making the selection of high-quality annotators a critical step in ensuring accurate annotations. The in-house annotation of 2,000 data pointsplayed a significant role in achieving this goal. To identify reliable annotators, we initiated a pilot task and only selected those with an accuracy rate of over 90% based on our in-house annotated dataset.
Orientation Annotation Category Annotation Degree Annotation No Hallucination 0 No Hallucination 0 Mild 0 Intrinsic Hallucination 1 Time Wrap 1 Moderate 1 Extrinsic Hallucination 2 Geographic Erratum 2 Alarming 2 Table 3: Annotations for : Orientation, Category, and Degree. We follow a three-level annotation process where we first determine whether there is a hallucination or not, and if yes, then what orientation. We assign labels 0, 1, and 2 for  no ,  intrinsic , and  extrinsic  hallucination.
Next, we determine the category of hallucination and label them ranging from 0 through 7, where 7 could be a miscellaneous case where the hallucination does not belong to any category. Finally, the degrees are labeled with 0, 1, and 2.Another crucial consideration when annotating data on crowdsourcing platforms is the compensation offered to annotators. While offering too little may deter interest, excessively high wages may attract undesirable spammers.
Achieving the ideal balance required several rounds of iteration to determine an appropriate compensation By carefully addressing factors such as selecting qualified annotators and establishing suitable compensation rates, we improved the quality of annotations obtained from crowdsourcing platforms. B.
5 Inter-Annotator Agreement We report Fleiss s kappa (  ) (Wikipedia_Fleiss s_Kappa) and Krippendorff s alpha (  ) (Wikipedia_Krippendorff s_Alpha) scores (see Tables 4 and 5) to access the reliability of agreement between the three annotators1. We compute agreement on 10% of total annotated entities and obtain substantial to almost perfect agreement in all three annotation types in both datasets, namely NYT and Politifact.
We have obtained nearly or more than 80% agreement in the case of orientation andcategory . The agreement on degree exhibits slight variation, as it relies on the subjective assessment of the percentage of hallucination in the sentence. This interpretation of percentage tends to differ among individuals.
We report both Fleiss s kappa and Krippendorff s alpha score because Fleiss s kappa is a statistical measure that allows us to find agreement among multiple annotators and Krippendorff s alpha is a statistical measure that allows us to handle various types of data like nominal (orientation andcategory ) and ordinal ( degree ). Fleiss s kappa Krippendorff s alpha Orientation 0.7911 0.8146 Category 0.7846 0.8499 Table 4: Inter-annotator scores for NYT dataset.
Fleiss s kappa Krippendorff s alpha Orientation 0.7587 0.8436 Category 0.8755 0.9328 Table 5: Inter-annotator scores for Politifact dataset. 1Three graduate studentsC Details on chosen LLMs C.1 Criteria for choosing LLMs Beyond the primary criteria for choosing performant LLMs, our selection was meant to cover a wide gamut of LLMs that utilize a repertoire of recent techniques under the hood that have enabled their exceptional capabilities, namely: FlashAttention (Dao et al.
, 2022) for memory-efficient exact attention. Multi-Query Attention (Shazeer, 2019) for memory bandwidth efficiency. SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) as the activation function instead of ReLU (Agarap, 2019). ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) for larger context width. RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) for per-normalization. RoPE (Su et al., 2022) to improve the expressivity of positional embeddings, etc. C.2 Details on Large Language Models Model details are given in Table 6. We use HuggingFace (Wolf et al.
, 2020) and OpenAI for implementing the large language models to generate the dataset. We used two datasets to curate HILT: (i) New York Times Tweets (NYT) for factually correct and (ii) Politifact dataset (Politifact) for factually incorrect prompts. E What is a high entropy vs. low entropy word? Figure 10: High entropy word vs. low entropy word - a side-by-side illustration.
In the context of language modeling, a high entropy word refers to a word or token that has a high level of uncertainty or unpredictability in its occurrence. In other words, it is a word that is relatively rare or has a low probability of appearing in a given context. Entropy is often used to quantify the level ofLLMs Parameter sizeLLM used in this paper Details GPT-3 175B gpt3 GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is an autoregressive language model by OpenAI.

It is trained on trillions of tokens. LLaMA65B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks. GPT-3.5 175B gpt3.5 (text-davinci-003) GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023b) is a sub-class of GPT-3 model family. It has 3 variants each with 1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters. Dolly 12B dolly-v2-12b Dolly (databricks, 2023) is an instruction-following large language model trained on the Databricks machine learning platform. OPT 175B opt-175B OPT (Zhang et al.
, 2022) is a decoder-only pre-trained transformer model ranging from 125M to 175B parameters. Although the performance of OPT175B is comparable to GPT-3, it only requires 1/7th the carbon footprint to GPT-4 170T gpt4 GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) was released by OpenAI in 2023. It is a large multimodal model that shows human-level performance on various professional and Alpaca 7B chainyo/alpaca-lora-7b Alpaca (Taori et al.
, 2023) is a language model fine-tuned using supervised learning from a LLaMA 7B model on 52K instruction-following demonstrations. BLOOM 176B bigscience/bloom BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) is similar to GPT-3 (auto-regressive model for next token prediction). However, it has been trained on 46 different languages and 13 programming languages. T0 11B bigscience/T0 T0 (Deleu et al., 2022) is trained on a diverse set of tasks and prompts leading to increased robustness to the prompt wording.
T0 outperforms or matches GPT-3, which is 16x larger in size and has 100s of billions of parameters. XLNet 340M xlnet-large-cased XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) is a generalized autoregressive pretraining model that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT because of its own autoregressive formulation. T5 11B t5-11b T5 (Raffel et al.
, 2020) is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task combination of unsupervised and supervised tasks Each task is converted into a Table 6: HuggingFace and OpenAI links for all LLMs.unpredictability associated with generating specific words or tokens. When a language model encounters a high entropy word, it means that the model has greater difficulty in accurately predicting or generating that word based on the context or preceding words.
High entropy words are often less frequent in the training data or have complex patterns of occurrence. For example, in a language model trained on news articles, words like  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis  (a technical term for a lung disease) would likely have high entropy, as they are infrequent and occur in specific contexts.
On the other hand, a low entropy word refers to a word or token that has a relatively high predictability or a limited range of potential next words given the context. In other words, it is a word that occurs frequently and is highly expected in a specific context. When a language model encounters a low entropy word, it means that the model has a higher confidence or accuracy in predicting or generating that word based on the context or preceding words.
For example, in a language model trained on English text, common words like  the,   and,  or  is  have low entropy because they occur frequently and are highly predictable in many contexts. These words tend to have a limited set of likely next words based on the preceding context. Fig. 10 illustrates an example of the entropy distribution over the set of words in an input sentence. In sentence 1, [MASK] token has low entropy since capital is the highest probable word in that sentence.
However, [MASK] token in sentence 2 has high entropy since it is quite uncertain as to what the masked token could be.

Remembering those they have saved spurs them to keep searching. A powerful new quake on Monday complicated their task.
Hallucinated textThe 7.0 magnitude quake that rocked the Aegean Sea was Turkey s deadliest in a decade, killing at least 109 people and injuring more than 1,000 . It toppled dozens of buildings in the cities of Izmir and Mugla and left dozens of people trapped beneath the rubble. Rescue crews have worked tirelessly all week, often in the dark and in perilous conditions. At the same time, they have had to cope with the emotional toll of finding bodies, many of them children, in the debris.
One rescuer, Hasan Cetin , said he was motivated by the thought of the survivors he helped save.

F.2 Evaluation strategy - how to determine no hallucination after mitigation? In order to assess the absence of hallucination following the implementation of the mitigation techniques ENTROPY BBand FACTUALITY GB, a random sample of 2,000 data points was taken.
This sample included 500 instances each of IFM, EFM, ISL, and ESL, ensuring a well-balanced distribution of the six hallucination categories within the data. Following the implementation of the ENTROPY BBmethod, which involved replacing words and phrases, we conducted a manual evaluation of the 2,000 samples.
This evaluation, carried out by six annotators, aimed to assess whether hallucination was alleviated or For the FACTUALITY GBmethod, we assumed that if the sentences were rewritten by humans, there would be no presence of hallucination. Therefore, for the highlighted sentences, hallucination was deemed waived. Results of this evaluation are reported in Fig. 5 and Table 24. F.3 Performance of ENTROPY BBvs. FACTUALITY GB Fig.
5 and Table 24 give a relative analysis of our two proposed mitigation techniques described in Section 6. We report the actual values in the Table 24. Our empirical findings indicate that ENTROPY BB technique primarily tackles less complex hallucination categories such as acronym ambiguity and numeric issues. However, FACTUALITY GBtechnique is more applicable for dealing with more complex cases of hallucinations.
Therefore, it is quite evident that a combination of both black- and gray-box methods would be the future direction of research.

AI-Generated TextThe protests, which began on June 16, were organized by citizens  groups and opposition political parties in response to recent laws passed by the Mexican Congress that critics say impose limits on the autonomy of the National Electoral Institute(INE), the body responsible for organizing and administering elections.
The new laws, which have been widely condemned by international human rights groups, allow for the president to appoint board members to the INE, a power that was previously reserved for members of Congress. In addition, the new laws allow for the president to appoint the head of the INE, and for him to control its budget. The protesters say the laws are part of a strategy by the president, Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador, to weaken the agency and prevent it from holding free and fair elections.
L pez Obrador has denied these allegations, saying the reforms are meant to create a more efficient and transparent electoral system. Fact Thefullform ofINE isInstitutoNacional Electoral.ExtrinsicPrompt In Ukraine, Vladimir Putin s invasion has met setback after setback. But its effect in Russia has been very different   and it has made Putin more dominant than ever at home.AI-Generated TextPutin s invasion of Ukraine has bolstered his standing among Russians.
It was seen as a way to protect the country s interests and to reassert its influence in its former Soviet satellites. His approval ratings soared to the highest they had been in years, and he was able to use the conflict to distract from economic woes and to crack down on domestic dissent. Putin has also used the conflict to foster a sense of Russian nationalism, which has helped to strengthen his grip on power.
Vladimir Putin is known to have an inside source group called Home land Komitet Gosudarstven noyBezopas nosti Front (HKGBF) that operates within his own government. The group handpicked by Putin himself for their loyalty and effectiveness in carrying out secret missions on behalf of the Russian government, consists of highly skilled operatives who carry out covert operations around the world on behalf of their leader.
As a result, he has become even more entrenched in the Russian political system, with his control over the country extending far beyond the Kremlin walls.

AI-Generated TextThe Amer icanChris tianLife University(ACLU) stepped in to address these issues. However, instead of calling for an investigation into the Newark Police Department, they demanded an immediate federal monitor to oversee all police activities. The decision surprised some members of the community who were hoping for a thorough investigation that would hold individual officers accountable for their actions.
Nevertheless, most people agreed that having an external body overseeing the police department s activities could lead to positive changes in policing practices. As soon as the federal monitor was appointed, they began conducting regular audits of police activity and reviewing complaints against officers. They also implemented new training programs aimed at improving officer-civilian interactions and reducing instances of excessive force.

He quickly became known for his maverick approach to his job, which often meant going beyond his mandate to investigate the effects of toxic chemicals on both wildlife and people. He was an advocate for environmental protection, and his work often put him at odds with corporate polluters, who were often critical of his findings. Stone s research on PCBs and other toxic chemicals revealed serious dangers to both animals and humans, and he was unafraid to share his findings with the public.
His work led to some significant breakthroughs, including the discovery of the first link between PCBs, cancer, and reproductive problems in people. He was also vocal in his criticism of the state and federal governments for not doing enough to protect the environment. Stone received a number of awards and honors for his work during his career, including the Audubon Medal, the highest honor given by the National Audubon Society. He was also inducted into the New York State Environment Hall of Fame in 2015.

Here s the story behind the film, which hits theaters Feb. 24.AI-Generated TextIn 1985, a large black bear was discovered in the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia with a strange story.
The bear had been spotted by hunters, and it was waddling around with a dead man s body in its mouth. After further investigation, it was discovered that the man had died from a drug overdose and that the bear had been scavenging the body for food. What was even more bizarre was that the bear had managed to open the man s backpack and consume the contents, which included over 75pounds ofcocaine that had been packed in plastic bags.
The bear was found to have a level of cocaine in its bloodstream that was seven times higher than the lethal dose for humans. It was eventually euthanized due to its extreme agitation and aggression. The animal s strange tale has since become a popular urban legend, and experts have warned against feeding wild animals, as it can pose a significant risk to both the animals and humans.
