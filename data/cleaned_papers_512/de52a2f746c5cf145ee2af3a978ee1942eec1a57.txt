e relatively few women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)  elds, and those who do choose to pursue careers in STEM face substantial hurdles throug hout their academic careers. Women are less likely than men to be credited for their scienti  c research and often suffer from the  Matilda Effect,  a pervasive bias that attributes the work of women to their male colleagues ( Rossiter, 1993 ).
Women are also less likely to be named as co-authors on scienti  c manuscripts in all STEM  elds at any stage of their careers. This problem is compounded by the fact that the percentage of women who are journal editors islow and has been estimated at less than 15% of all scienti  cj o u r n a l s( Liu F et al., 2023 ).
To address some of these limitations, a Research Topic in the  eld of systems biology was commissioned to highlight some of the cutting-edge research being done by women in theareas of translational systems biology and silico trials. The Research Topic was edited by three women and includes four original articles authored by 21 individuals. A total of eight women, ranging from students to senior academicians, served as the  rst and senior authors.
In the  rst article on the Research Topic,  Systems biology of asphalt pollutants and their molecular targets , Rozewski et al. examined the effect of asphalt on human health and disease. Asphalt, which is an aggregate that contains thousands of different compounds, is widely used topave roads, roof houses, or weatherproof structu res and constitutes an environmental exposure for a large swath of the population.
As asphalt ages, volatile organic compounds are released; these can have potentially deleteriou s effects on human health. In the article, the consequences of exposure to asphalt emissions and toxicity studie s following dermal or inhalation exposure are reviewed, and supporting evidence is provided to show that asphalt exposure can lead to dermalor airway irritation and changes in gene expression .
The investigators modeled the relationship between asphalt emissions, health effects, and biomolecular targets using network analysis. Thisnetwork illustrates how some components of as phalt are linked to changes in gene expression that, in turn, have been linked to cardiovascular di seases such as myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, or hypertension, and malignanci es such as cervical, lung, or prostate cancer.
Based on these previously unrecognized relationships, t he authors call for further studies of the selected volatile compounds released from aging asphalt tha t are toxic to understand t heir health effects in order to modify these emissions.OPEN ACCESS EDITED AND REVIEWED BY University of Vermont, United States jleopold@bwh.harvard.

published  Evaluation of intracoronary hemodynamics identi  es perturbations in vorticity , a study that used computational  uid dynamics to model coronary artery hemodynamics and identify hemodynamic features that differbetween coronary arteries with and without stenoses.
In thisstudy, coronary angiograms from patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and pressure gradient measurement across coronary artery stenosis (a clinical test known as fractional  ow reserve testing that is used to decide whether a therapeuticintervention is needed) were used to create 3-dimensionalgeometries for in silico analysis.
Intracoronary hemodynamics were analyzed using the massively parallel  uid solver HARVEY, and simulation results were validated using particle imagevelocimetry and clinical measurements obtained during cardiac catheterization. These analyses identi  ed signi  cant differences in velocity, shear stress, and vorticity in a coronary artery with astenosis compared to one without a stenosis from the sameindividual.
The simulations also revealed that there weredifferences in vorticity in a normal-appearing coronary arteryfrom patients who had stenosis in another vessel compared tonormal coronary arteries from a control subject with no coronaryartery disease. This study demonstrates the added value of in silico studies using computational  uid dynamics to analyze intracoronary hemodynamic pro  ling based on medical imaging data.
In Investigating the co morbidity of COPD and tuberculosis, a computational study , Sershen et al. used a multi-scale model and in silico simulations to investigate the m echanisms by which individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonar y disease (COPD) are at greater risk for harboring a tuberculosis infecti on.
The researchers used a validated, physiologically relevant ,a g e n t - b a s e dm o d e lo f Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M t b )i n f e c t i o na n di n c o r p o r a t e di n  ammatory cell recruitment, pulmonary dynamics , and variations in cytokines and chemokines into the model to evaluate Mtb clearance or retentionamong patients with COPD and lung damage with or withoutcombustible tobacco use.
A total of 63 COPD hosts with reducedlung capacity and varying degree s of emphysema were studied via simulations. The modeling demonstrated that in the presence of COPD,there was a greater likelihood of disseminated Mtb infection and retention of Mtb, as opposed to the clearance of infection that was typical of the non-COPD models. T he study also showed that there was no real compounding effect of s moking on the immune response to Mtb.
Thus, in silico modeling can predict both the biology and the outcome of Mtb infection in hosts with different degrees of lungfunction. Chahine and Le Roch complete the series with a review of platforms and technologies for omics analyses of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , and describe systems-basedmethodologies used for discovery in an article entitled  Decrypting the complexity of the human malaria parasite biology through systemsbiology approaches .
The review details the Plasmodium life cycle, the history of the sequencing of the Plasmodium genome, and the Plasmodium transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. The review also includes a description of tools and technologies for DNA sequencing, chromatin interactions and assembly, chromosomal architecture, and RNA pro ling and sequencing platforms.
The authors then provide a comprehensive work  ow of how omics pro ling, data analysis, bioinforma tics, and mathematical modeling can be used to understand host-para site interactions and identify relevant targets for clinical diagnostics and drug therapies, and forthe development of anti-malarial therapies and vaccines. Taken together, these studies exemplify systems biology research focused on in silico trials that were conducted by talented female investigators in STEM.
This Research Topic has been viewed severalthousand times and is a gateway to a  eld that will bene  t from the continued contributions of female academicians. We are proud tohighlight the outstanding research accomplishments of thesewomen in STEM and look forward to more female colleaguescontributing to the growing  eld of systems biology.
