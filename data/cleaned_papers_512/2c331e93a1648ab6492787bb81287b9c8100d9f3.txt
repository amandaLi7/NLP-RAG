During the observation period, the mean CCN number concentrations ranged from 1345 1270 cm 3at SS = 0.1% to 3267  2325 cm 3at SS = 0.3%. The mean critical activation diameters ( D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 172  13 nm, 102 8 nm, and 84 7 nm, corresponding to the average hygroscopicity parameters (  CCN) of 0.34, 0.33, and 0.26, respectively. The diurnal variations in D50suggested that the local primary emissions signi cantly enhanced D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.
3%, but had less in uence on D50at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm) of particles emitted from primary sources. As PM 2.5concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. At a speci c SS, D50decreased with increases in the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal mixing degree during atmospheric aging was bene cial to CCN activation.
In this study, the commonly used f44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with  organd failed to describe the variations in  org. Instead, the variations in  org can be well parameterized with the Org/BC ratio. The correlation between  derived from bulk chemical compositions and CCN measurements was substantially improved when this  orgscheme was adopted, emphasizing the importance of considering  orgvariations on deriving  chem from aerosol chemical composition.
Keywords: size-resolved CCN activity; aerosol chemical composition; mixing state; organic Aerosol particles can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) under supersaturation (SS) conditions [ 1,2], participating in cloud processes and altering the microphysical and optical properties of clouds, which indirectly affect the global climate [ 3,4].
The Sixth Assessment Report from IPCC (2021) highlighted that aerosol indirect effects remain the most considerable uncertainty in evaluating the anthropogenic contribution on current and future climate change [ 5]. Remote sensing has been widely used to study aerosol cloud climate interactions and provide extensive datasets. However, it is dif cult to identify the proportion of CCN from retrieved total aerosol concentration (CCN activation Remote Sens. 2023 ,15, 4119. https://doi.org/10.
3390/rs15174119 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensingRemote Sens. 2023 ,15, 4119 2 of 15 ratio), which would introduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol-related effects on cloud microphysics based on remote sensing. Furthermore, accurate retrievals of cloud droplet number concentrations ( Nd) using remote sensing measurements is challenging.
Based on the ground-level measurements of aerosol activation properties and parcel theory, the Ndfor non-precipitating Planetary Boundary Layer clouds can be derived. Then, the parameters of the retrieval can be optimized through the closure analysis on Ndobtained from remote sensing data and in situ measurement at ground level [6].
The ability of aerosol particles to participate in cloud processes, known as CCN activity, is one of critical parameters in studying the indirect radiation effects and environmental impacts of aerosols. At a given SS condition, the CCN activity is mainly determined by their size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state [ 7 9]. Previous studies suggested that the size distribution of aerosols is a more critical factor than their chemical composition in governing CCN activity [ 2,10].
However, the impact of chemical composition on CCN activity signi cantly increases in situations with low supersaturation [ 11,12]. The classical K hler theory [ 1], combining the Raoult s law effect with the Kelvin effect, illustrates that the aerosol particle activation depends on particle size, chemical composition, and SS.
Petters and Kreidenweis [ 13] developed a single hygroscopicity parameter  in parameterizing the Raoult term, which enabled the quanti cation of CCN activity without requiring information of the dissolved compounds. However, ambient aerosols are complex mixtures, and their sizes and compositions vary at different stages of atmospheric aging process [ 14 16], which include numerous primary and secondary organic components as well.
These impose various effects on particle activation behavior and reduce the applicability of the K hler theory in describing the actual atmospheric aerosols, especially for organic aerosols (OA). Earlier studies speci cally focused on parametrizing the empirical correlations between the OA oxidation level and organic hygroscopicity parameter (  org) [17 21], suggesting a linear correlation between  organd the oxygen-to-carbon atomic ratio (O:C).
However, the systematic variability in parametrizations between  organd the O:C ratio determined from the different studies remains large [ 22]. Kuang et al.
(2021) recently pointed out that secondary OA (SOA) from different precursors and formation processes may result in SOA with different chemical composition, functional properties, and microphysical structure, consequently exerting distinct in uences on  organd rendering single oxidation level parameters (such as O:C) unable to capture those differences [23]. To obtain regional parameters for aerosol particle activation, numerous  eld campaigns have been conducted globally.
Alongside the considerable spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability in aerosol activation characteristics is also essential for accurate CCN prediction [ 7]. The CCN activity can be characterized by two important parameters: activation critical diameter ( D50) and activation ratio (AR).
These two parameters can be directly measured through combining cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) [ 24,25], and can also be determined by aerosol chemical composition and particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements using the K hler equation and internal mixture hypothesis [ 20,26 28]. The CCN activity closure analysis, based on the above two methods, is a key means of investigating the impacts of aerosol properties on activation processes.
Although CCN measurements were conducted under different environments in the North China Plain, only a few studies established a linkage between CCN activity and chemical composition with a high time resolution [ 27,29 31]. Additionally, due to the Clean Air Action of the Chinese government initiated in 2013, stringent emission controls have been imposed to decrease  ne particulate matter pollution (PM 2.5, particles smaller than 2.5  m in diameter) [ 32]. In the Beijing region, notable reductions in PM 2.
5concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by signi cant changes in its chemical composition [ 33 35]. Instead of organics and sulfate, organics and nitrate are now the dominant components of Beijing winter haze pollution. Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity in urban Beijing.Remote Sens.
2023 ,15, 4119 3 of 15 In this study, the CCN activity and aerosol chemical composition were simultaneously measured in Beijing wintertime, using a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne aerosol chemical species monitor (ACSM). An overview of the observation data is presented in Section Overview the Observation Data. The impacts of aerosol chemical composition and mixing state on CCN activity are discussed in Section 4.1. Finally, in Section 4.
2, through closure analysis of the aerosol hygroscopicity derived from CCN activity and chemical composition, we estimate  organd parameterize it with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
Measurement Site Measurements of size-resolved CCN activity, aerosol size distribution and composition (organics, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, and black carbon) were conducted on the rooftop of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) building during the period of 15 January 3 March 2022. All aerosol measurements were performed downstream of a PM 10impactor.
The ambient air passes through the impactor and then enters the automatic regenerating adsorption aerosol dryer (TROPOS, Leipzig, Germany), which can dry the sample air to a low RH (RH < 30%) to ensure comparability of measurements [ 36]. The measurement site (116 19 E, 39 57 N, approximately 53 m above the ground) is located in a traf c-intensive area of the west 3rd ring road in Beijing, China, which represents the urban environment in uenced by intense anthropogenic emissions [37,38]. 2.2.1.
Size-Resolved CCN Activity and PNSD Measurements Size-resolved CCN spectra and activation ratios were measured using the SMCA initially proposed by Moore et al. (2010) [ 39]. In this work, the SMCA consisted of a CCNc100 (DMT Inc., Blouder, CO, USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, model 3081, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), and a condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3772, TSI Inc.). In the SMCA system, the combined DMA and CPC were used as a SMPS during the measurements.
The dry particles after the diffusion dryer were neutralized by the X-ray neutralizer and were subsequently classi ed by the DMA in a scanning mode. Then, the particles were split into two streams: one to the CPC for measurement of total particle number concentration ( NCN) and another to the CCNc-100 for measurements of the CCN number concentration ( NCCN). The  ow rates of the CPC and CCNc-100 were 1.0 L min 1 and 0.5 L min 1, respectively. With the total sample  ow of 1.5 L min 1and sheath  ow of 7.
5 L min 1, the SMCA was protocolled to measure particles at a mobility diameter range of 8 360 nm. The DMA was operated in scanning mode with a time resolution of 180 s, including a scan time of 165 s and a retrace time of 15 s. The supersaturation in the CCNc-100 was set to be 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively, with a time interval of 9 min (corresponding to three diameter scans of the DMA) for each SS during the experiment.
Only the second scan for each SS is used as the CCNc needs time for SS stabilization. Therefore, a complete SS cycle lasted ~0.5 h. The CCNc-100 was regularly calibrated with ammonium sulfate particles at the four SSs (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.7%). 2.2.2. Aerosol Chemical Composition Measurement Non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM) including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organics with dry aerodynamic diameters below 2.5  m was measured by an ACSM equipped with a PM 2.
5aerodynamic lens at 10 min time resolution. The ACSM data were analyzed using standard data analysis software (Tofware v2.5.13). The collection ef ciency (CE), which accounts for particle loss due to bouncing off the standard vaporizer, was derived from composition-dependent calculation following the algorithms proposed by Middlebrook et al. (2012) [ 40].
The calibrations of ionization ef ciency (IE) and relative ionization ef ciencies (RIEs) followed the standard procedures described in previous studies by using 300 350 nm pure ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate particles [41,42] . TheRemote Sens. 2023 ,15, 4119 4 of 15 RIE values used for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, 3.4, and 1.3, respectively.
Equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass was measured with an aethalometer (AE33, MAGEE Scienti c, Berkeley, CA, USA) at 1 min. The instruments used dual-dots con guration to auto-correct for the loading effect. The measured absorption was converted to BC mass using an apparent mass absorption cross section (MAC) of 7.7 m2g 1at a wavelength of 880 nm [ 43]. The  = 880 nm is chosen to avoid the potential interference of brown carbon at shorter wavelength. The multi-scattering enhancement factor (C value) of 2.
88 at 880nm wavelength was used to exclude the multiple light scattering effects. In addition, PM 2.5mass concentration data from air quality monitoring station (Wanliu) operated by the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau were used, which is located in the northwest and northeast direction of the CAMS observation site, with a distance of approximately 3 km.
The concurrent meteorological parameters (including wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and air temperature) are from the national surface meteorological observation stations of the China Meteorological Administration. 2.3.1. CCN Activation TheNCNandNCCN data were used to calculate the size-resolved CCN activation ratio (AR), which de ned as the ratio of NCCN toNCNat each particle size ( NCCN/NCNvs.Dp).
The in uence of multiple-charge particles and DMA transfer function on AR were corrected basing on a modi ed algorithm developed by Hagen and Alofs (1983) [ 44] and Deng et al. (2011, 2013) [ 25,45]. Figure S1 gives a typical example of NCCN/NCNvs.
Dpduring the experiment, and the AR curve can be obtained by  tting the NCCN/NCNratio with the AR=a+b/(1+exp (D50 Dp where ais the offset from 0 in the y direction and bis the height of the upper plateau of the sigmoid function, D50is the critical diameter, and  sis a measure for the width of the sigmoid function. D50is also called the critical diameter or the activation diameter, that is, the diameter at which 50% of the particles are activated at a speci c SS.
The variation in D50at a given SS can be attributed to the variation in the number fraction of hygroscopic particles or its hygroscopicity, which can be indicated the CCN activity of a particle population. Then, the hygroscopicity parameter  CCN, derived from CCN measurements, is calculated from the critical supersaturation ratio ( Sc) and D50from the following equation [13]: where  s/ais the surface tension of the solution/air interface and the solution is temporarily assumed to be pure water (0.
0728 N m 1at 298.15 K), Mwis the molecular weight of water, Ris the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol 1K 1),Tis absolute temperature,  wis the The steepness of the AR curve represents the degree of external mixture or the heterogeneity of aerosol chemical composition, which can be quanti ed by the ratio of (D75 D25)/D50[46].D75andD25correspond to the diameters at which 75% and 25% of the particles are activated on the AR curve.
Internal mixture implies that particles at any given dry size have equal  with ( D75 D25)/D50= 0. Alternatively, various  at a given particle size indicate externally mixed aerosol compositions with higher ( D75 D25)/Dc values. Although the sigma term from sigmoid  t has been used in previous studies to estimate aerosol mixing state [ 19,30], the ( D75 D25) value can provide a more accurate representation of aerosol mixing state.
This is because the CCN measurement uncertainties would be larger due to the extremely low concentration of activated particles at the lowRemote Sens. 2023 ,15, 4119 5 of 15 AR range. In addition, the relationship between activation ratio and particle size exhibits nonlinear behavior when AR < 25% or >75% (Figure S1). In contrast, within the particle size range of D25toD75, the AR increases rapidly and exhibits a relatively linear relationship with the particle size.
The sigma term represents the width of entire particle diameter range used in sigmoid  t. Instead of the sigma term, using the ( D75 D25)/D50value to describe the steepness of the AR curve can reduce the uncertainties in estimating aerosol 2.3.2. Aerosol Hygroscopicity Derived from Aerosol Chemical Composition The hygroscopic parameter  is solely determined by composition and re ects the Raoult term in K hler theory [ 13].
By assuming internal mixing, the aerosol hygroscopicity ( chem) can be derived from aerosol chemical composition measurements. The  chem of aerosol particles with multiple compositions is contributed by the  of each volumeweighted composition, following the Zdanovskii Stokes Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule [ 28], where irepresents the ith composition,  iis the volume fraction of each composition in the bulk, and kiis the hygroscopic parameter for each composition present in a multiplecomposition particle.
For the compositions determined by ACSM the AE33 measurements, a simple ion-pairing scheme [9] was used in this study, expressed as: All species are then converted to volume by assuming a density. The density (  i) and ivalues for all species used in this study are listed in Table 1 [ 15]. Here, a constant  of 0.1 is used for particulate organics [47,48]. Table 1. Density (  ) and hygroscopicity parameter (  ) of each pure composition used in this study.
Species Density (kg m 3) Overview the Observation Data The time series of meteorological parameters (such as wind speed, wind direction, ambient air temperature, and relative humidity (RH)), PM 2.5mass concentration, NCN, and NCCN at SS of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% are shown in Figure 1. During the observation periods, the wind speed was mainly less than 3 m s 1, with an average of 1.3 m s 1.
The relatively low wind speeds (<2 m s 1) were generally associated with southerly winds, whereas higher wind speeds (>3 m s 1) corresponded to northerly winds. When persistent southerly winds prevail (such as January 17 24th), the daily average PM 2.5concentration and RH signi cantly increased from 19 to 156  g m 3, and from 31% to 77%, respectively. The cumulative enhancement of PM 2.

The RH was below 60% for most of the time, with an average of 38 18%. The temperature ranged from  9 to 17 C, with an average of 0.2  4.7 C. These meteorological parameters indicated relatively dry and cold weather conditions during Remote Sens.

The RH wa s below 60% for most of the time, with an average of 38   18%. The temperature ranged from  9 to 17  C, with an average of 0.2   4.7 C.
These meteorological parameters indicated relatively dry and cold weather conditions during this campaign. Figure 1.

The temporal variations in both aerosol number and mass concentration are shown in Figure 1c.
The range of aerosol number concentration varied from ~1000 to 17,000 cm 3, with an average of 6714   3117 cm 3. The PM 2.5 mass concentration ranged from 2  g m 3 to 197  g m 3, with an average of 34   39  g m 3. During the most increasing stages of PM 2.5 mass concentration, the aerosol number conc entration consistently varied with the mass concentration.
However, when an intermi ttent fog event occurred from January 23rd to 24th, the number concentration decreased with  the increasing mass concentration. This suggests that the wet scavenging e  ect of fog droplets substantially reduced aerosol number concentration, but enhanced liquid-phase reactions alternatively resulting in the increases in mass concentration. The CCN concen tration at low supersaturations (0.1%) was signi cantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.

The particle chemical composition is closely related to its hygroscopicity and activation characteri stics.
The hygroscopic properties of aerosols are mainly determined by composition, with inorganics having higher hygroscopicity [9,50] than less water-soluble substances, such as BC [51,52] or primary organics [53]. At a given SS, particles with higher hygroscopicity are corresponding to smaller  D50, indicating such particles are more prone to activation and form cloud droplets. During the observation period, organic ma tter and nitrate were the most important components, with average percentages of 42.4%   11.

Aerosol chemical composition had a remarkable variation with PM 2.5 concentration levels, characterized by organics dominating at low PM 2.5 concentration levels (<25 g m 3) and nitrate gradually becoming the dominant composition with increases in PM 2.

The CCN concentration at low supersaturations (0.1%) was signi cantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.

The time series of PM 2.5chemical composition, dry particle number size distribution (PNSD), and D50are given in Figure 2. The particle chemical composition is closely related to its hygroscopicity and activation characteristics.
The hygroscopic properties of aerosols are mainly determined by composition, with inorganics having higher hygroscopicity [ 9,50] than less water-soluble substances, such as BC [ 51,52] or primary organics [ 53]. At a given SS, particles with higher hygroscopicity are corresponding to smaller D50, indicating such particles are more prone to activation and form cloud droplets.

The time series of PNSD in Figure 2b shows that aerosol particles mainly concentrate in nucleation mode ( Dp< 100 nm) during the clean periods.

Aerosol Chemical Properties The diurnal variations in D50 at di erent SS, the mass fraction of m/z 44 in organic mass spectrum ( f44), aerosol chemical composition, and PNSD are given in Figure 3. The sources and properties of aerosol particles vary with di  erent size ranges, leading to a diverse diurnal variation in D50 at di erent SS (Figure 3a c).
As a typical tracer for SOA formation, the f44 can be associated with OA hygroscopicity owing to their positive correlations reported in previous studies [54,55]. Both f44 and the sum fraction of hygroscopic inorganic components (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) had a noticeable peak in the afternoon (Figure 3d,e), implying they were signi  cantly in  uenced by photochemical oxidation in the daytime.
Meanwhile, the minimum of D50 for all three SS conditions occurred around 15:00, corresponding to the diurnal peak time of f44 and the fraction of inorganic components. This suggests photochemical reac tions on daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. Figure 2.

Note that the diurnal cycles of  D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3% exhibited a remarkable maximum around 18:00, with additional peaks occurring at 7:00 and 12:00.
In contrast, no prominent diurnal peak occurred in the diurnal cycle of D50 at SS = 0.1%. Tra  c and cooking emissions are the main sources of primary OA (POA) in Beijing, and these fresh emis-sions could lead to a decrease in f44 [56,57]. Therefore, the reduction time in the f44 diurnal cycle matched to the periods of daily source emissions, such as morning and evening traf c peaks, as well as lunch and dinner times.
Consequently, the hydrophobic POA was not favor for CCN activation, leading to an increase in D 50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. In addition, the diurnal variation in aeroso l number concentration within the size range of 60 150 nm was consistent with that of D50 (SS = 0.2% and 0.3%) (Figure 3f ), indicating that particles within this size range were signi  cantly in  uenced by tra  c and cooking emissions.
For particles larger than 150 nm, their nu mber concentration showed no signi  cant changes during the periods of concentrated emissions, suggesting that local primary emissions had few in  uences on particle properties with this si ze range. Therefore, there were no significant peaks observed in the diurnal variation in  D 50 at SS = 0.1%, which was generally larger than 150 nm during this campaign (Figure 3a). The mean value of PM 2.5 mass concentration during this campaign is 25  g m 3. Once the PM 2.
5 mass concentration exceeded this mean value, a period of pollution accumulation typically occurred for one to several days. Therefore, in order to further illustrate the impacts of aerosol chemical composition on CCN activity at the di  erent pollution levels, we de  ned the PM 2.5 mass concentrations  25  g m 3 and >25  g m 3 as clean and polluted conditions, respectively.
Note that the bulk aerosol composition measured by the ASCM is sensitive to larger particles, which contri bute the majority of the total mass. Thus, the bulk composition tends to mainly re  ect the composition information for larger particles. Here, only the relationships between the fraction of each chemical component and D SS = 0.1% are presented in Figure 4. Under the polluted conditions, the fraction of nitrate increased with PM 2.5 concentrations and exhibited a negative correlation with D50 (r = 0.

These relationships indicated that as the concentration of PM 2.5 increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitioned from  sulfate to nitrate. Compared with the secondary inorganic components, both the fracti ons of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their limited hygroscopicity.

The solid circle, error bars denote th e median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. For a speci  c SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, implying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity.
Particularly, the variation in the mixing stat e exhibits high sensitivity to D 50 when the ratio drops from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be a ttributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhanc ement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and hygroscopicity. The relationship between ( D75   D25)/D50 and D50 can be well  tted with an exponential function under the conditions of  SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the condition of SS = 0.

Further analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of ( D75   D25)/D50 (0.3 0.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM 2.5 concentration (>60  g m 3) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from satisfactory tting by using an exponential function.
Under these conditions, the hygroscopicity and size of aerosol particles were enlarg ed due to the increasing fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a more diverse population of   values, as separated by some of them already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these enlarged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size.
As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) from a wider size range with various   values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chemical 4.2.

As can be seen,  ccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for mountain site, which had a higher  ccn for the smaller particles. In these results,  ccn rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas  ccn almost stays constant at  Dp of 100 to 200 nm.
This is consistent with previously reported results on the sizeresolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying composition within small particle size range an d relatively stable compositions for larger particles. In addition, the  ccn observed at urban sites were signi  cantly lower than that at rural sites, which can be a ttributed to the enhanced aerosol aging state from urban to rural 0.6 Figure 5.

2023 ,15, 4119 12 of 15 Duplissy et al. (2011) pointed out that the uncertainty in the estimation of  orgdecreases with increasing organic fraction; thereby, only data featuring organic fractions larger than 50% were used in this calculation [17]. As is shown in Figure 7b, the  orgshows a positive relationship with the concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC), which can be used to re ect the contribution of SOA to total OA [ 60,61].
Several previous studies suggested  orgas a function of the f44 or O:C [54,55] ; however,  orgwas not correlated to the f44 during the observation periods of this study. This is similar to a recent study conducted by Kuang et al. (2021), which pointed out that  orgwas weakly correlated with O:C, but well correlated with the sum mass fraction of aged biomass burning OA and more oxygenated OA in total OA [ 23].
In order to parameterize the relationship between  organd Org/BC ratios,  orgvalues were binned by Org/BC in increments of 5. Then, a power  tting function  org= 0.05 (Org/BC)0.42was obtained. This  tting function was adopted to reconstruct the hygroscopicity parameter (  chem_new ). As is shown in Figure 7a, a better correlation between  chem and ccnwas achieved after using the parameterized  orginstead of constant value (0.
1), indicating suitable  orgscheme play an important role in deriving  chem from aerosol chemical composition. The in situ measurements of CCN activity at ground level can be applied to optimize the parameters of retrieving cloud microphysics with remote sensing data. Notable reductions in PM 2.5concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by signi cant changes in its chemical composition in the North China Plain.
Therefore, more investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN activity. In this study, aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and CCN number concentration were measured concurrently to investigate the size-resolved CCN activity during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. The critical activation dimeter D50derived from size-resolved activation ratio can be negatively associated with CCN activity.
During the observation period, the average CCN concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 1340 cm 3, 2750 cm 3, and 3270 cm 3, corresponding to the average D50of 172 nm, 102 nm, and 84 nm, respectively. The impacts of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state on CCN activity were investigated. The results show that photochemical oxidation on a daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity.
Conversely, the local emissions (such as traf c and cooking) signi cantly enhanced D50at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had few in uences on D50at SS = 0.1% due to the limitations of particle size from emission sources. As PM 2.5concentration increases, the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. For carbonaceous components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50 due to their weak hygroscopicity.
The mixing state of particles was also estimated based on the size-resolved AR curve  tting. At a speci c SS, D50decreased with increasing the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal-mixing degree resulting from atmospheric aging facilitated to the enhancement of CCN activity. Aerosol hygroscopicity parameter  ccnderived from the SMCA method was sizedependent, varying from 0.26 to 0.34 as Dpincreased from 84 to 172 nm.
Based on the bulk aerosol chemical composition measured by the ACSM, the  chem values were calculated using the ZSR method. The OA hygroscopicity  orgwas estimated by the closure analysis between  chem and ccn. However, the commonly used f44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated with  organd failed to describe the variations in  orgduring the observation periods of this study.
Instead, the variations in  orgcan be well parameterized using the Org/BC ratio, which is usually used as a tracer for the contribution of SOA to total OA. The parameterization of  orgsubstantially improved the correlation between  chem and ccn, emphasizing the importance of considering  orgvariations when deriving  chem from aerosol chemical composition.Remote Sens. 2023 ,15, 4119 13 of 15 Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.
