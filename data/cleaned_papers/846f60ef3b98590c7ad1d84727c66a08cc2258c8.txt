ABSTRACT
Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV) aims to detect
the event timestamps described by the natural language query from
untrimmed videos. This paper discusses the challenge of achieving
efficient computation in TSGV models while maintaining high performance.
 Most existing approaches exquisitely design complex architectures
 to improve accuracy with extra layers and loss, suffering
from inefficiency and heaviness. Although some works have noticed
that, they only make an issue of feature fusion layers, which can
hardly enjoy the highspeed merit in the whole clunky network. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel efficient multi-teacher model
(EMTM) based on knowledge distillation to transfer diverse knowledge
 from both heterogeneous and isomorphic networks. Specifically,
 We first unify different outputs of the heterogeneous models
into one single form. Next, a Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU)
is built to acquire high-quality integrated soft labels from multiple
teachers. After that, the KAU module leverages the multi-scale video
and global query information to adaptively determine the weights
of different teachers. A Shared Encoder strategy is then proposed to
solve the problem that the student shallow layers hardly benefit from
teachers, in which an isomorphic teacher is collaboratively trained
with the student to align their hidden states. Extensive experimental
results on three popular TSGV benchmarks demonstrate that our
method is both effective and efficient without bells and whistles. Our
code is available at https //github.com.

1 INTRODUCTION
Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV), which aims to
ground a temporal segment in an untrimmed video with a natural language
 query, has drawn widespread attention over the past few years
[27]. There is a clear trend that top-performing models are becoming
 larger with numerous parameters. Additionally, the recent work
shows that accuracy in TSGV tasks has reached a bottleneck period,
while the combination of complex networks and multiple structures
is becoming more prevalent to further improve the ability of the
model, which will cause an expansion of the model size. However,

the heavy resource cost required by the approaches restricts their
applications to platforms and devices with limited computational
capability and low memory storage.
In order to improve efficiency, FMVR [ 6] and CCA [ 19] are
proposed to construct fast TSGV models by reducing the fusion
time. Although they decline the inferred time significantly, the whole
network is still time-consuming, even surpassing the conventional
methods, as depicted in Figure 1a. The time of the whole network
encompasses the duration from inputting the video feature (e.g., I D
or C D) and query sentence to producing predictions in this paper.
To be specific, FMVR and CCA require encoding and storing ofarXiv 2308.03725 1  [cs.CV]  7 2023 17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Renjie Liang, Hui Lu, Yiming Y ang, and Li Li
the video feature in advance, followed by inference based on the
query. However, the encoding process is highly time-consuming. In
real-world scenarios, there may not be an opportunity to pre-encode
the video. The processing of their methods is more similar to the
Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR), e.g. retrieval moment
from an existing video corpus by a query. Our objective is to expand
the efficiency interval to cover the entire TSGV model.
To tackle this challenge, the natural approach is to reduce the
complexity of the network, which can involve decreasing the hidden
dimension, reducing the number of layers, and eliminating auxiliary
losses. Nevertheless, all of these methods will lead to a decrease
in performance to some extent. One promising technique is knowledge
 distillation [ 7] to mitigate the decrease in performance and
maintain high levels of accuracy when lighting the network. Initially,
knowledge distillation employed a single teacher, but as technology
advanced, multiple teachers have been deemed beneficial for imparting
 greater knowledge[ 4], as extensively corroborated in other
domains[ 18]. Multi-teacher strategy implies that there is a more diverse
 range of dark knowledge to be learned, with the optimal knowledge
 being more likely to be present [ 22]. Regarding the TSGV task,
different models will predict results with varying quality when given
the same input, as shown in Figure 1b. Thus far, multiple-teacher
knowledge distillation has not been studied and exploited for the
TSGV task.
An immediate problem is that different models will produce heterogeneous
 output, e.g., candidates for proposed methods, or probability
 distribution for proposal-free methods. Another question is
how to identify optimal knowledge from multiple teachers. In addition,
 knowledge can hardly backpropagate to the front layers from
the soft label in the last layers [ 15], meaning that the front part of the
student model usually hardly enjoys the benefit of teachers  knowledge.
 Until now, here are three issues we need to deal with  i) how to
unify knowledge from the heterogeneous models, ii) how to select
the optimal knowledge and assign weights among these teachers,
and iii) how the front layers of the student benefit from the teachers.
Firstly, We unify the various types of outputs from multiple heterogeneous
 models into 1D probability distribution through corresponding
 processing. This enables us to seamlessly integrate the
knowledge when training model. The 1D probability distribution is
the output of the span-based method from the proposal-free catalog,
 which has an inherent speed advantage over the proposal-based
methods. Then, a Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU) is built that
associates the knowledge from the different models. KAU, which
consists of multiple parallel transformations with different receptive
fields, leverages multi-scale information[ 9], thus obtaining target
distribution with higher quality instead of simply averaging these
probabilities. It adaptively determines the importance weights of
different teachers with respect to a specific instance based on both
the teacher and student representation, avoiding turning the weights
of different teachers manually, which are sensitive hyperparameters
 for multiple teachers  distillation [ 11]. Finally, a shared layer
strategy was designed to learn shallow knowledge from the teacher.
Specifically, an isomorphic teacher is added and co-trained with our
student model while sharing their encoder layers and aligning their
hidden states, which guarantees that the student is able to gain global
and exhaustive knowledge.Through the above approach, the whole student model is required
to learn from both the isomorphic and heterogeneous teachers which
serve as complementary cues to provide an enhanced supervisory
signal when model training. During inference, we only exploit the
student model to perform inference, which does not add computational
 overhead. To sum up, this paper s primary contributions can
be distilled into three main points, which are outlined below 
 We propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework
for the TSGV task. This approach substantially reduces the time
consumed and significantly decreases the number of parameters,
while still maintaining high levels of accuracy.
 To enable the whole student to benefit from various teacher models,
we unify the knowledge from different models and use the KAU
module to adaptively integrate to a single soft label. Additionally,
a shared encoder strategy is utilized to share knowledge from the
isomorphic teacher model in front layers.
 Extensive experimental results on three popular TSGV benchmarks
 demonstrate that our proposed method performs superior to
the state-of-the-art methods and has the highest speed and minimal
parameters and computation.
2 RELATED WORK
Given an untrimmed video, temporal sentence grounding in videos
(TSGV) is to retrieve a video segment according to a query, which is
also known as Video Moment Retrieval (VMR). Existing solutions
to video grounding are roughly categorized into proposal-based and
proposal-free frameworks. We also introduce some works on fast
video temporal grounding as follows.
2.1 Proposal-based Methods
The majority of proposal-based approaches rely on a number of
carefully thought-out dense sample strategies, which gather a set of
video segments as candidate proposals and rank them in accordance
with the scores obtained for the similarity between the proposals
and the query to choose the most compatible pairs. Yuan et al . [24]
offer a Semantic Conditioned Dynamic Modulation (SCDM) based
on [5], which can combine the query with visual representations
for correlating the sentence-related video contents and dynamically
change the temporal convolution according to the query semantics.
In order to produce excellent video temporal candidates, Xiao et al .
[20] propose a Boundary Proposal Network (BPN) using a third
party model. Liu et al . [10] creat the Motion-Appearance Reasoning
Network (MARN), which makes use of retrieved object information
and models their relationships for improved localization, to differentiate
 frame-level features in videos. Rich temporal information
is also taken into account in some works. Zhang et al . [29] convert
visual features into a 2D temporal map and encode the query in
sentence-level representation, which is the first solution to model
proposals with a 2D temporal map (2D-TAN). BAN-APR [ 3] utilize
 a boundary-aware feature enhancement module to enhance the
proposal feature with its boundary information by imposing a new
temporal difference loss. Currently, most proposal-based methods
are time-consuming due to the large number of proposal-query interactions.Efficient

2.2 Proposal-free Methods
Actually, the caliber of the sampled proposals has a significant impact
 on the impressive performance obtained by proposal-based
methods. To avoid incurring the additional computational costs associated
 with the production of proposal features, proposal-free
approaches directly regress or forecast the beginning and end times
of the target moment. Wang et al . [17] aggregate contextual information
 by obtaining the relations between the current segment and
its neighbor segments and propose a Contextual Boundary-aware
Prediction (CBP). VSLNet Zhang et al . [28] exploits context-query
attention modified from QANet Yu et al . [23] to perform fine-grained
multimodal interaction. Then a conditioned span predictor computes
the probabilities of the start/end boundaries of the target moment.
SeqPAN [ 26] design a self-guided parallel attention module to effectively
 capture self-modal contexts and cross-modal attentive information
 between video and text inspired by sequence labeling tasks
in natural language processing. Yang and Wu [21] propose EntityAware
 and Motion-Aware Transformers (EAMAT) that progressively
localize actions in videos by first coarsely locating clips with entity
queries and then finely predicting exact boundaries in a shrunken
temporal region with motion queries. In addition, Huang et al . [8] introduce
 Elastic Moment Bounding (EMB) to accommodate flexible
and adaptive activity temporal boundaries toward modeling universally
 interpretable video-text correlation with tolerance to underlying
temporal uncertainties in pre-fixed annotations. Nevertheless, with
the improvement of performance, huge and complex architectures
inevitably result in higher computational cost during inference phase.
2.3 Fast Video Temporal Grounding
Recently, fast video temporal grounding has been proposed for more
practical applications. TSGV task usually requires methods to efficiently
 localize target video segments in thousands of candidate proposals.
 In fact, several early algorithms, e.g., common space-learning
methods and scanning-based methods, make some contributions to
reducing the computational costs. According to [ 6], the standard
TSGV pipeline can be divided into three components. The visual
encoder and the text encoder are proved to have little influence in
model testing due to the features pre-extracted and stored at the beginning
 of the test, and cross-modal interaction is the key to reducing
the test time. Thus, a fine-grained semantic distillation framework
is utilized to leverage semantic information for improving performance.
 Besides, Wu et al . [19] utilize commonsense knowledge
to obtain bridged visual and text representations, promoting each
other in common space learning. However, based on our previous
analysis, the inferred time proposed by [ 6] is only a part of the entire
prediction processing. The processing from inputting video features
to predicting timestamps is still time-consuming.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we first give a brief task definition of TSGV in
Section 3.1. In the following, heterogeneous knowledge unification
is presented as a prerequisite in Section 3.2.1. Then we introduce the
student network (Section 3.2.2), shared encoder strategy (Section
3.2.4) and knowledge aggregation unit (Section 3.2.3) as shown in 2.
Finally, the training and inference processes are presented in section
3.3, as well as the loss settings.3.1 Problem Formulation

respectively. The start and end times of the ground truth moment are
indicated by 洧랦洧마nd洧랦洧,1 洧랦洧 洧랦洧 洧녢. Mathematically, TSGV is
to retrieve the target moment starting from 洧랦洧마nd ending at 洧랦洧뇩y
giving a video 洧녤and query洧녟, i.e.,F洧녢洧녡洧냨洧녤  (洧녤,洧녟)  (洧랦洧,洧랦洧).
3.2 3.2.1 Heterogeneous Knowledge Unification.
Compared to the proposal-based method, the span-based method
doesn t need to generate redundant proposals, which is an inherent
advantage in terms of efficiency. Meanwhile, 1D distribution carries
more knowledge than the regression-based method. Hence we unify
various heterogeneous outputs into 1D probability distribution and
develop our network based on the span-based method, as shown in
Figure 2. The outputs of the span-based method are the 1D probability
 distributions of start and end moments, denoted as 洧녞洧,洧녞洧 R洧녵.
To keep concise, we adopt 洧녞 R2洧녵without subscripts to express
stacked probability for the start and end moments.
We simply adopt the softmax function to the outputs of the spanbased
 methods and obtain probability distributions.

洧)洧녞洧 洧녡洧녶洧녭洧노洧녴洧녩洧논(洧녞 
洧) (1)
2D-map anchor-based method is a common branch of the proposalbase
 method, such as [ 29], [3]. A 2D map 洧녡 [洧멇롐,洧녱]  R洧녵 洧녵is
generated to model temporal relations between proposal candidates,
on which one dimension indicates the start moment and the other
indicates the end moment. We calculate the max scores of 洧녡by
row/column as start/end distributions.
洧녞洧 洧녡洧녶洧녭洧노洧녴洧녩洧논(max
洧녱洧멇롐,洧녱)
洧녞洧 洧녡洧녶洧녭洧노洧녴洧녩洧논(max
洧녰洧멇롐,洧녱)(2)
As for the regression-based method, we can get a time pair (洧노洧,洧노洧)
after computation. Then the Gaussian distribution is leveraged to
simulate the probability distribution of the start/end moments as
follows 
洧녞洧 洧녡洧녶洧녭洧노洧녴洧녩洧논(洧녜(洧노洧,洧랥2))
洧녞洧 洧녡洧녶洧녭洧노洧녴洧녩洧논(洧녜(洧노洧,洧랥2))(3)
The proposal-generated method will generate a triple candidate
list洧녡  (洧노洧녰洧,洧노洧녰洧,洧洧녰) R3 洧녲, where洧녲is the number of proposal candidates.
 Similarly, we use the Gaussian distribution to generate the
probability distribution of the start/end moment for each candidate.
Then we put different weights on various candidates and accumulate
them 
洧녞洧 洧녡洧녶洧녭洧노洧녴洧녩洧논(  
洧녰洧洧녰洧녜(洧노洧녰

where洧랥2is the variance of Gaussian distribution 洧녜.Conference 17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Renjie Liang, Hui Lu, Yiming Y ang, and Li Li

Figure 2  An overview of the proposed framework. EMTM mainly consists of three components  the student model, the shared encoder,
and the KAU. The shared encoder with isomorphic structures is utilized to align their hidden states. Heterogeneous model outputs are
unified into 1D probability distribution as shown in the right. Then it is adopted to adaptively determine the importance weights of
different teachers with respect to a specific instance based on both the teacher and student representation. During the inference stage,
only student model is adopted for fast TSGV .
3.2.2 Student Network.
For each video, we extract its visual features 洧놓 R洧녵 洧녬洧녺with a
pre-trained convolutional neural network model [ 2], where洧녵is the
length of extracted features. For each query 洧녟, we initialize the word
features 洧놎 R洧녴 洧녬洧룍y GloVe embeddings.
We first project 洧놓and洧놎into the same dimension 洧녬by projection
matrices, and incorporate a position embedding to every input of
both video and query sequences. Then we feed the results into the
VisualEncoder andQueryEncoder respectively 
洧놓  VisualEncoder(FFNv(洧놓) 洧냦洧녷)
洧놎  QueryEncoder(FFNq(洧놎) 洧냦洧녷)(5)
where FFNis projection matrices, 洧냦洧녷denotes the positional embeddings.
 VisualEncoder andQueryEncoder consist of stacked 1D
convolutional blocks to learn representations by carrying knowledge
from neighbor tokens.
To enhance the cross-modal interactions between visual and textual
 features, we utilize the context-query attention (CQA) strategy
 [ 12], and aggregate text information for each visual element.
Specially, we calculate the similarity scores S R洧녵 洧녴between
each visual feature and query feature. Then the attention weights of
visual-to-query (A) and query-to-visual ( B) are computed as 
A S洧 洧놎  R洧녵 洧녬
B S洧 S洧녢
洧녫 洧놓  R洧녵 洧녬(6)whereS洧르ndS洧녫are the row-wise and column-wise normalization
ofSby softmax operation, respectively. Finally, the output of visualquery
 attention is written as 
洧놓洧륋롐 FFN [洧놓  A 洧놓  A 洧놓  B] (7)
where 洧놓洧륋롐 R洧녵 洧녬 FFNis a single feed-forward layer   denotes
element-wise multiplication. 洧놓洧륋롐믈s the fused multi-modal semantic
features with visual and query attention. Then we follow [ 26] and
calculate 洧농洧눖and洧농洧눉. Hence, the prediction part of TSGV model can
be defined as 
(洧농洧눖,洧농洧눉) Predictor(洧놓洧뉧눙) R洧녵(8)
3.2.3 Knowledge Aggregation Unit.
Our goal is to combine all the unified predictions from 洧녪branches to
establish a strong teacher distribution. Previous image classification
work [ 31] adopted a simple convolution block as the gate module to
generate an importance score for each branch. But a simple convolution
 block cannot effectively capture the contextual representation
due to the temporal scale variation problem which widely exists in
video tasks. Thus, capturing multi-scale information is required to
handle this problem. Inspired by the previous works [ 9], we design
the Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU), which consists of multiple
parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leveraging
both local and global information to obtain a more accurate target
probability. The architecture of the proposed KAU is depicted in

Considering saving more original information, we first take the

Further, we incorporate the average pooling of query features 洧녟

to the channel-wise multiplication. Our experiments (see Section
4.5.1) prove that the weights generated by KAU can achieve better
distillation performance.
3.2.4 Shared Encoder Strategy.
When the knowledge that exists in soft label backpropagates from
back to front, the shallow layers hardly enjoy the benefit, due to
the non-linear activity function and dropout design. But the feature
invariant in the shallow layers [ 25] inspires us, we share several
shallow layers of the student with an isomorphic teacher. Through
collaborative training with the teacher network, the shallow layers
can acquire additional knowledge.
Specifically, a student and an isomorphic teacher share their text
and query encoder, shown in Figure 2. The encoder consists of
several conv D in our network, which is lightweight and fast due
to its inherent characteristic. The VisualEncoder ,QueryEncoder ,
andFFNlayers in eq. (5) denote the shared layers in our network.
3.3 3.3.1 TSGV Loss.
The overall training loss of our model is described as follows. For
the student and the isomorphic teacher, the hard loss (i.e. label loss)
is used to optimize distributions of start/end boundaries.

As we discussed previously, the learned ensemble information
serves as complementary cues to provide an enhanced supervisory
signal to our student model. As a result, we introduce multiple

3.3.2 Inference.
The teacher and student models will be collaboratively trained, while
we only adopt the student model for TSGV during testing. The
learned rich information serves as complementary cues to provide
an enhanced supervisory signal to the TSGV model. Compared with
FMVR [ 6] and CCA [ 19], we won t pre-calculate and store visual
features.
4 4.1 Datasets
To evaluate the performance of TSGV , we conduct experiments on
three challenging video moment retrieval datasets, all the queries in
these datasets are in English. Details of these datasets are shown as
follows 
Charades-STA [5] is composed of daily indoor activities videos,
which is based on Charades dataset [ 16]. This dataset contains 6672
videos, 16,128 annotations, and 11,767 moments. The average length
of each video is 30 seconds. 12,408 3,720moment annotations
are labeled for training and testing, respectively 
ActivityNet Caption [1] is originally constructed for dense video
captioning, which contains about 20 120 seconds. As a dual task of dense video captioning,
video moment retrieval utilize the sentence description as a query
and outputs the temporal boundary of each sentence description.
TACoS [14] is collected from MPII Cooking dataset [ 14], which
has 127 286.59seconds. TACoS
has 18,818 query-moment pairs, which are all about cooking scenes.
We follow the same splits in [ 5], where 10,146,4,589, and 4,083
annotations are used for training, validation, and testing, respectively.
4.2 Evaluation Metrics
Following existing video grounding works, we evaluate the performance
 on two main metrics mIoU   mIoU" is the average predicted Intersection over Union
in all testing samples. The mIoU metric is particularly challenging
for short video moments 
Recall  We adopt   R@洧녵,IoU 洧랞  as the evaluation metrics,
following [ 5]. The   R@洧녵,IoU 洧랞  represents the percentage of
language queries having at least one result whose IoU between top- 洧녵
predictions with ground truth is larger than 洧랞. In our experiments,
we reported the results of 洧녵 1and洧랞 {0.3,0.5,0.7}.
The Metric of Efficiency   Time, FLOPs, and Params are used to
measure the efficiency of the model. Specifically, the time refers to
the entire inferring time from the input of the video and query pair
to the output of the prediction. FLOPs refers to floating point operations,
 which is used to measure the complexity of the model. Params
refers to the model parameter size except the word embedding.
4.3 Implementation Details
For language query 洧녟, we use the 300-D GloVe [ 13] vectors to initialize
 each lowercase word, which are fixed during training. Following
the previous methods, 3D convolutional features (I D) are extracted
to encode videos. We set the dimension of all the hidden layers as
128, the kernel size of the convolutional layer as 7, and the head size
of multi-head attention as 8in our model. For all datasets, models
are trained for 100epochs. The batch size is set to 16. The dropout
rate is set as 0.2. Besides, an early stopping strategy is adopted to
prevent overfitting. The whole framework is trained by Adam optimizer
 with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. The loss weight 洧띺
is set as 0.1 in all the datasets. The temperate was set to 1, 3, 3 on
Charades-STA, ActivityNet, and TACoS. The pre-trained teacher
models are selected in SeqPAN, BAN-APR, EAMAT, and CCA, and
we use SeqPAN as an isomorphic teacher to share the encoder. More
ablation studies can be found in Section 4.5. All experiments are
conducted on an NVIDIA RTX A5000 24GB memory. All
experiments were performed three times, and reporting the average
of performance.
4.4 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods
We strive to gather the most current approaches, and compare our
proposed model with the following state-of-the-art baselines on three
benchmark datasets 
 Proposal-based Methods  SCDM [ 24], 2D-TAN [ 29], BANAPR
 [3].
 Proposal-free Methods  VSLNet [ 28], SeqPAN [ 26], EMB
[8], EAMAT [21].
 Weakly Supervised Methods  CPL [30], CNM [30]
 Fast Methods  FVMR [6], CCA [19]
The best performance is highlighted in bold and the second-best is
highlighted with underline in tables.
Overall Efficiency-Accuracy Analysis
Considering that fast TSGV task pays the same attention to the
efficiency as the accuracy, we evaluate FLOPs, Params, and Times
for each model. For a fair comparison, the batch size is set to 1 for
all methods during inference. Besides, we also calculate the sum of
the accuracy in terms of  R1@0.3 1@0.5 , named sumACC
to evaluate the whole performance of each model.
As Table 1 shows, our method surpasses all other methods and
achieves the highest speed, minimal FLOPs and Params on all threeEfficient Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos with Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation Conference 17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

datasets. We can find that our proposed method is at least 2000
times fewer in FLOPs than state-of-the-arts proposal-based models
 (SCDM and 2D-TAN). According to sumACC, we also notice
that our proposed EMTM outperforms these two models by gains
of at most 26.75% on Charades-STA and 14.30% on ActivtyNet.
Though these proposal-free approaches such as VSLNet, SeqPAN
and EMB also achieve favorable performance with low computational
 expenses, our proposed method still outperforms better overall.
Compared to the baseline method SeqPAN, although there is a slight
accuracy decrease, we achieve 4 2x faster. Despite
 the parameter size of VSLNet is at the same level as our method,
we outperform it significantly in terms of accuracy. For instance,
EMTM achieves 15.30% absolute improvement by  sumACC  on
Charades-STA. When it comes to CCA, which is proposed for fast
TSGV , EMTM outperforms 16950 121x fewer
in model parameter size on Charades-STA. The above comparison
illustrates that our method has significant efficiency and accuracy
advantages.
Accuracy Analysis
We compare the performance of our proposed method against
extensive video temporal grounding models on three benchmark
datasets. As shown in Table 2, we can observe that our method performs
 better than other methods in most metrics. Compared with
FVMR and CCA, our model performers better in all metrics. Especially,
 EMTM achieves an absolute improvement of 4.58% on
Charades- STA and 5.34% on TACoS on the metric "R@1, IoU 0.7".
Note that R@1, IoU 0.7 is a more crucial criterion to determine
whether a TSGV model is accurate or not. The comparison of performance
 "on R1, IoU 0.7" shows that our method can predict results
with higher quality.
Then, we compare our model with much more TSGV methods
in more detail. Firstly, we compare EMTM with previous proposalbased
 methods  SCDM and 2D-TAN. From the results in Table 2,
we observe that our EMTM achieves great performance compared
with the aforementioned methods on most of the metrics. We also
notice that EMTM surpasses 2D-TAN on Charades-STA and TACoS
by (16.55%, 11.76%) in terms of  R@1, IoU 0.7 . Moreover, we
compare our method with previous proposal-free methods  VSLNet,MethodShared

SeqPAN, EMB and EAMAT. Compared with them, our proposed
CCA method achieves better performance. On ActivityNet, we outperform
 VSLNet by gains of (1.51%, 2.14%) in terms of  R@1,
IoU 0.5  and "mIoU". Besides, it also surpasses the recent work
EAMAT with an average 7.22% improvement on the metrics  R@1,
IoU 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 . ActivtyNet has larger scales than the other two
datasets. The results indicate that our method also performs well in a
more complex visual-text environment. In addition, our model offers
apparent benefits over weakly supervised methods. It indicates that
our method can localize the moment with higher quality. Our EMTM
obtains more accurate results because multiple teachers make the
model have the ability to comprehend complex cross-modal relationships.
 In fact, the simple but effective use of transferred knowledge
replaces large and repetitive cross-modal interaction and reduces the
time and computational cost. It validates that EMTM can efficiently
and effectively localize the target moment boundary.
4.5 Ablation Studies
In this part, we perform in-depth ablation studies to analyze the
effectiveness of the EMTM. All experiments are performed three
times with different random seeds to eliminate the contingency.Conference 17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Renjie Liang, Hui Lu, Yiming Y ang, and Li Li

 In detail, we adopt EAMAT, EAMAT & BAN-APR, EAMAT
 & BAN-APR & SeqPAN, which correspond to one teacher,
two teachers and three teachers respectively.
4.5.1 Effects of Main Components.
In our proposed framework, we design the sharing encoders (SE) to
learn shallow knowledge from the isomorphic teacher, while knowledge
 contained in soft targets is taught by label distillation(LD). To
better reflect the effects of these two main components, we measure
the performance of different combinations. As table 3 4 show,
each interaction component has a positive effect on the TSGV task.
On Charades-STA, the full model outperforms w/o SE by gains
of 1.44% on metrics  R@1, IoU 0.7  and exceeds  w/o LD  by
(0.08%, 1.40%, 2.26%, 0.61%) on the all metrics. Besides, the full
model also outperforms  w/o SE-LD  by a large margin on all metrics
 while achieving a significant 2.26% improvement in terms of
 R@1, IoU 0.7 . Similarly, our full model has made significant
improvements in every metric compared with the variant "EMTM
w/o SE-LD" on ActivityNet.
Obviously, the interaction between sharing encoders and multiple
 teachers  label distillation leads to a favorable improvement
in performance, which proves that various teachers inject useful
knowledge into our student model. As a result, the student model
has become stronger than every teacher.
4.5.2 Effect of Number of Teacher Models.
We investigate the influence of different numbers of teacher models
on Charades-STA. As shown in 4, the performance presents a rising
 tendency with the increase of teachers. If SeqPAN is removed,
the accuracy will be reduced by about 1% in terms of R1@0.7.
When simply utilizing EAMAT, the performance will reach 38.25%
and 52.69% compared to the original student 32.71% and 52.50%
on mIoUR and 1@0.7, which proves the effectiveness of EAMAT.
However, there exists a great distance of nearly 2% between our
full model and its variant  no teacher , showing that one teacher
is not enough. In summary, our improvements are not only from
soft targets with one single teacher, but also from the learning of
structural knowledge and intermediate-level knowledge with fused
multi-teacher teaching. Multiple teachers make knowledge distillation
 more flexible, ensemble helps improve the training of student
and transfer related information of examples to the student.
4.5.3 Effect of Different Degree of Lightweight Models.
We evaluate the influence of different degrees of lightweight models
by adjusting their hidden dimension 洧녬on Charades-STA. As shown
in 5, obviously as 洧녬decreases, the FLOPs and model parameter size
will decline, which would also reduce the performance of our model.

4.6 Qualitative Analysis
Two samples of prediction on Charades-STA are depicted in Figure
6. In general, the moments retrieved by full EMTM are closer to the
ground truth than that are retrieved by EMEM without utilizing the
shared encoder and label distillation strategy. The first sample indicated
 our approach can refine the predictions when the basic model
already obtained satisfactory results. The second sample shows the
basic model trend to predict the boundary position, possibly due
to its limited understanding of the video. As a result, the model
relies on biased positional information to make moment predictions.
However, utilizing a shared encoder and label distillation approach
can provide additional information that enables the model to more
precisely predict the moment boundary.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we focus on the efficiency of the model on Temporal
 Sentence Grounding in Videos and try to expand the efficiency
interval to cover the entire TSGV model. A knowledge distillationEfficient Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos with Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation Conference 17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA
framework (EMTM) is proposed, which utilizes label distillation
from multiple teachers and a shared encoder strategy. We additionally
 design corresponding processes to unify heterogeneous outputs,
enabling a smooth knowledge distillation in the subsequent step.
Our model achieves high effectiveness and efficiency at the same
time. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits
strong generalization.
In the future, we will pay attention to video feature extraction in
TSGV , which is also a time-consume process. In real scenarios like
surveillance video retrieval with raw videos as input, this issue is
much more critical. We tend to explore the lightweight end-to-end
model that includes the part of video feature extraction, thereby eliminating
 the constraints of computational capacity and high-demand
storage.REFERENCES
