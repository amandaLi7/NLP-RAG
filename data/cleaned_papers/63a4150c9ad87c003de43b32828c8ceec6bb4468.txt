Abstract  Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artiﬁcial-intelligence-based technologies
 have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice.
These voice proﬁling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental
 factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to inﬂuence voice. Recently, some have
also explored the prediction of parameters whose inﬂuence on voice is not easily observable through
data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors
that can possibly inﬂuence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially
deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-ﬁnding algorithm
that attempts to ﬁnd links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and
genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by proﬁling
technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed
algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature that of the clinically observed
effects of speciﬁc chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected
people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to
a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show
that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported
to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses conﬁrm that the
methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases
where their existence has not been otherwise observed.

1. Introduction
Aside from diseases that affect the biological structures and processes involved in
voice production, myriad other factors are known to inﬂuence voice. Some simple examples
include age, exhaustion, smoking, which often makes the voice sound hoarse, or alcohol,
which makes the voice sound slurred. The ensuing changes in the voice signal can be
thought to be the  biomarkers  that give us information about the corresponding causative
factors and allow us to infer their nature through voice analysis. Such relationships form the
basis for artiﬁcial-intelligence (AI)-based voice proﬁling techniques that attempt to deduce
a speaker s bio-relevant and environmentally related parameters from voice. However,
virtually all research on voice proﬁling, diagnostics, and biometrics is currently predicated
on clinically observed or statistically inferred relationships between changes in voice and
the corresponding factors that are thought to cause them. The relationships that are chanced
upon in this manner provide the basis for building predictive AI (machine-learning- or
rule-based) mechanisms that can deduce the underlying factors that potentially inﬂuence
voice through voice analysis.
For example, it is known that smoking affects voice. To establish this, a humanobservation-based
 approach would be  (a) an audiological one based on hearing the voices
of smokers to determine if they deviate from those of non-smokers in an acoustic sense,
Entropy 2023 ,25, 897. https //doi.org/10.3390/e25060897 https //www.mdpi.com/journal/entropyEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 2 33
and/or (b) a visual one where an analyst studies the spectrogram (or some other visual
representation) of the speech signal to ﬁnd patterns that distinguish one class of recordings
from another. The spectrogram in this case is a  feature representation . A statistical
approach , on the other hand, would gather examples of speech recordings from people
who smoke and those who do not, extract feature representations from the recordings, and
ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in the statistics of these features obtained from the two sets of
recordings. Alternatively, a classiﬁer model may be trained to discriminate between voice
samples from smokers and non-smokers. If high test accuracies are achieved in this task,
the existence of a biomarker for smoking in voice is indicated. This is a purely data-driven
approach for establishing the existence of biomarkers in voice.
The problem with these approaches is that neither is scalable. The number of factors
that can inﬂuence the human persona is virtually inﬁnite. Human observations are limited
to the effects that are perceptually discernible in voice, and data-based discovery is conﬁned
 and limited by the availability of representative data. This paper provides a more
formal methodology for establishing the existence of biomarkers and for identifying which
factors are likely to affect voice and which are not. The methodology is based on genomic
considerations, as explained below.
Before we proceed, however, it must be noted that this is notan algorithm for computational
 biology research. Its use to aid biological discovery or establish biological facts in
its current form has not been tested. It is only meant to establish the tentative links that are
needed to justify computational proﬁling efforts.
1.1. A genomic-Based Approach to Detect the Existence of Biomarkers
The working hypothesis for this paper, and one that has also recently been proposed in
the context of voice proﬁling [ 1], is that if a given factor exerts an inﬂuence on the speaker,
and if pathways of biological effects can be traced from that inﬂuence to the speaker s
voice production system, then voice must be affected (and must carry biomarkers for the
factor). The methodology proposed herein is a literal test of this hypothesis in that it traces
biological pathways from cause to effect to establish the existence of biomarkers.
For this, we begin with the genetic underpinnings of human vocal capabilities. In this
context, it is important to differentiate between voice production and speech production.
The former refers to the production of acoustic energy in any form within the vocal tract,
and the latter refers to the modulation of the acoustic signals thus produced to form words
and sentences in a language used for interpersonal communication. We will use the term
 vocal production  to refer to both.
Vocal production in humans is a complex and multifaceted process and involves
interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors. The genetic basis of vocal
production is not fully understood. Nevertheless, a number of genes have been found to be
involved in the process. Some that are now known to inﬂuence vocal production include 
1. FOXP2 2 , which is involved
in the development and function of the brain, including the areas responsible for
language and speech.
2. TAFT   This gene codes for a protein called TAFT1, which is involved in the development
 and function of the larynx, a structure in the throat that is involved in vocal
production.
3. OTOF   This gene codes for a protein called Otoferlin, which is involved in the development
 and function of the auditory system, including the inner ear. Feedback from
this system greatly inﬂuences vocal production.
4. MYO A   This gene codes for a protein called Myosin XVa, which is involved in the
development and function of the auditory system, including the hair cells in the inner
ear.
5. SEMA A   This gene codes for a protein called Semaphorin 3A, which is involved in
the development and function of the auditory system, including the auditory nerve.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 3 33 2, one of the protein-coding
genes mentioned above. It is involved in a variety of biological pathways and cascades that
are thought to regulate language development. It is autosomal dominant, and mutations in
it cause speech and language disorders (OMIM  SPCH1). In this paper, we choose FOXP2
as an example gene to work with. This choice was only made for illustrative purposes. The
methodology presented in its context is itself a generic one and can be applied to any of
the genes listed above (and possibly others that exist) whose functions are relevant to the
analysis at hand.
For illustrative purposes, we proceeded with the broad and simplifying assumption
that any inﬂuence on speech and language is ultimately the phenotypic expression of
FOXP2. The objective was thus to 
  Formalize the methodology to ﬁnd a link between an inﬂuencing factor and this gene 
  Validate the methodology 
  Demonstrate its predictive potential.
To accomplish these goals, for simplicity, we chose the example of a category of
medical conditions for which the underlying genetic causes are known  the effects of the
conditions are observed and reported in medical literature, and the effects can involve
problems with vocal production.
The medical conditions we choose are chromosomal microdeletion syndromes, which
result from the deletion of speciﬁc genes in speciﬁc cytogenetic locations on human chromosomes.
 We propose an algorithm to ﬁnd a link between the genes in the regions of
microdeletions, to FOXP2. The connections in these links are derived using a path-search
algorithm applied to a graph composed from known biological pathways that involve
these (and other) genes. The  strength  of these connections is then deﬁned in terms of the
characteristics of the linkage discovered. In the validation stage, our goal is to show that
there is a direct correlation between the strength of linkages found and the extent of vocal
symptoms experienced by the affected individuals.
Before we proceed with the algorithm, in the paragraphs below, we ﬁrst provide a
working categorization of speech disorders, as reported in various medical literature. This
is necessary for the clarity of the results presented later in this paper.
1.2. Anomalies in Speech Production
From a bio-mechanical perspective, human speech is the result of two complex processes
 that happen simultaneously  one that produces sound the pressure wave that
we sense as the voice signal and another that modulates this signal (through articulator
movements) to produce speech, thus altering the voice signal s frequency characteristics
and shaping it into sounds with unique identities that are uttered sequentially to form
words and sentences in a language. The overall process of voice and speech production
is driven and controlled by neuromuscular and cognitive factors to different degrees. It
is also moderated to different degrees by feedback obtained through auditory pathways.
Generally, diseases that affect these functions, naturally also inﬂuence speech and alter the
characteristics of the voice signal to proportional degrees. In most cases, when reporting
such changes, references to  speech  implicitly include voice, as we see below.
Changes in speech are categorically described in terms of six major aspects of speech
production  respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance, evolution, and prosody. In
addition, terminology that relates to voice quality is often used to describe speech. Voice
quality is, however, a subjective term and comprises many constituents, or sub-qualities
(e.g., nasal, breathy, rough, twangy, etc.), that refer to the perceptual ﬂavor of speech (or
how a speaker s voice sounds to the listener). Physical anomalies that affect the shape
and tissue structure of the vocal tract cause changes in all of these aspects. Speech delays
and language difﬁculties result from cognitive and learning disabilities. These and other
intellectual disabilities affect articulation, evolution, and prosody. Their effect on voice also
manifests as changes in voice quality. Craniofacial anomalies affect the physical dimensionsEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 4 33
of the vocal tract structures, often restricting the movement of the articulators as a result
and causing speaking impairments. Motor problems affect articulation, phonation, and
respiration. These cause speech aberrations and also affect voice quality. Hearing problems
disturb the feedback mechanisms involved in controlling speech production and often lead
to difﬁculties in prosody and articulation of speech.
In this paper, we do not focus explicitly on voice acoustic or quality characteristics, focusing
 instead on problems with speech (that subsume voice characteristics to some extent)
as described under the OMIM (referring to the catalog Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man  https //www.omim.org/ (accessed on 21 2022)) category  Speech and
Language disorders (SPCH1) . Even this category, however, is too broad and encompasses
a wide range of speech problems, such as delays in acquisition of speech abilities, retardation
 in speech development with age, speech anomalies resulting from language delay,
expression, and articulation.
For the purpose of this paper, it is necessary to make ﬁner distinctions between these
categories. The problem in doing so is that the language used in the literature to describe
voice- and speech-related problems in the context of genetic syndromes is not standardized.
For example, the terms  speech disorder ,  speech disturbance ,  speech anomalies ,
 speech aberrations , and  speech impairment  may each refer to a range of symptoms
that may be overlapping to various degrees. For the purpose of this paper, it is therefore
useful to map the broad range of speech problems into the following categories that are
sufﬁciently discriminatory in terms of the different aspects of speech production mentioned
above while still being limited in number 
1. Absence of speech  Phrases (in clinical/scientiﬁc literature) referring to (a) no development
 of speech capabilities, (b) no expressive speech, which is mostly limited
to vocalizations, or (c) almost absent speech with a severely limited vocabulary
(0 4 words).
2. Apraxia  Phrases referring to difﬁculty using language correctly while speaking,
leading to speaking and communication difﬁculties.
3. Delayed speech  Phrases referring to developmental delay, the retarded development
of the ability to speak, or the retarded acquisition of language skills and communication
 skills (ability to use a vocabulary correctly to communicate in a cogent manner).
4. Dysarthric speech or dysarthria   Phrases referring to speaking problems resultant
from damaged, paralyzed, or weakened muscles of the articulators caused by motor
problems. Dysarthria results in slurred words, poor phonation, etc. The speaker uses
vocabulary as in normal speech but ﬁnds it difﬁcult to move the articulators (tongue,
lips, jaw, etc.) correctly to form the proper sounds to utter the words.
5. Idiosyncratic speech  Phrases referring to poor conformance to cogent language or
incoherent language with articulation abnormalities.
6. Impaired speech  Phrases referring to poor articulation and phonation, as well as
difﬁculties that result in sparse and disﬂuent speech.
2. Methodology
As mentioned earlier, we consider the example of syndromes resulting from chromosomal
 microdeletions and focus on their symptoms relating to speech abilities.
Chromosomal microdeletions are structural anomalies of chromosomes in which small
sections of a chromosome are deleted or missing. The loss of the speciﬁc set of genes from
the deleted section often results in phenotypic changes. An implicated gene is a gene in the
deleted region of a chromosome that is known to cause much of the observed effects of
the syndrome in affected individuals. These are identiﬁed through microarray and other
studies. For most microdeletion syndromes, some such genes have been identiﬁed and
reported in the medical literature. We use this information from the medical literature as-is
in the sections below.
Although the human genome is very large in comparison to a typical chromosomal
microdeletion region, microdeletions often cause serious problems. In fact, only a smallEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 5 33
set of deletions are compatible with life or fetal survival. This set continues to expand
with the addition of newly discovered deletions in surviving individuals who have the
means to reach genetic testing facilities. However, it is still a very small set and can be
exhaustively studied. Most known deletions are well documented in the literature, both
from the genetic and medical perspectives. Information about the genes associated with
them is readily available through well-curated publicly accessible repositories. Thus, they
are good example cases for this paper.
The methodology proposed herein analyzes ensembles of biological pathway chains ,
each of which connects a speciﬁc gene in the cytogenetic region of chromosomal microdeletion
 to the FOXP2 gene. A  biological pathway  here is deﬁned as in standard terminology,
referring to a physiological process at the cellular level that is enabled by the action of
multiple genes that perform speciﬁc functions within the process.
We deﬁne a pathway chain as the sequential linkage of pathways where links between
pathways are shared genes (implicitly meaning that the molecules resultant from genes are
shared we will use the term  gene  with this implicit meaning in the context of pathways
for generality going forward). For example, consider a pathway that signals for a cell to stop
dividing when an injury to the nuclear DNA strand is being repaired. It may involve the
coordinated chemical action of molecules that are formed by the transcription of multiple
genes that perform different functions. It would alsobe connected to a repair pathway by
necessity. Thus, the two pathways can be considered to be links in a single pathway chain
(they must share some genes in a functional sense) that perform the function of relaying
messages from one pathway to another. Such genes may also perform other functions that
are essential to both pathways.
The hypothesis we make here is that for a gene, if a chain from its pathway(s) (i.e., from
the biological pathways it contributes to directly) extends to pathways that inﬂuence voice
production, then the phenotype resultant from the absence or aberrant functioning of the
gene can be expected to include anomalies in speech production and voice characteristics.
2.1. Voice Chains
Our deﬁnition of a voice chain extends our deﬁnition of a pathway chain in that the
head of the chain must now necessarily be a pathway that includes a gene that inﬂuences
voice or speech production, while the termination of the chain is not necessarily a biological
pathway but could include any given set of genes with a common characterization (such as
a common cytogenetic location or function).
In this paper, the voice-related gene chosen is FOXP2, but in other analyses, voice
chains could involve other genes (e.g., as in [ 2]) without loss of generality. The terminal link
in the chain is taken to be a genetic microdeletion syndrome. A voice chain thus establishes
a relationship between an inﬂuencing factor a genetic microdeletion syndrome in this
case and a corresponding effect on voice/speech production. We refer to a voice chain
that includes a sequence of αpathways from the microdeletion region to the FOXP2 gene
as a level- αvoice chain (Figure 1). The speciﬁc genes on the microdeletion that link it to the
voice chain are referred to as  chainlink  genes. We represent the set of chainlink genes
that connect a microdeletion to level- αvoice chains as the chainlink set VNα. Since we
aim to analyze the genetic basis of the effect of microdeletions on voice, these chainlink
sets are the focus of our analysis. Note that the subscript NinVNαdenotes the manner in
which overlaps or linkages between biological pathways are deﬁned. This subscript is ﬁxed
for the purpose of this paper, for which the exact manner in which pathway overlaps are
deﬁned is described in Figures 1 2 below. We however leave the Nin place to facilitate
future differentiations and variations of the proposed algorithm based on how the pathway
intersections (or unions) may be deﬁned.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 6 33 1. Voice chains of different levels. In this reversed perspective ideogram, a link depicts a
pathway, the black dots on it are genes, and the chromosomes that they belong to are shown as rods
where relevant. The lines connecting genes are only meant for visual clarity. Chains are formed with
respect to genes on a chromosome (a microdeletion region in this case, shown shaded in yellow). In
this ideogram, Gene-1 2 lie on the same pathway, contributing to a level-1 voice chain. In a
level-2 chain, FOXP2 and the microdeletion region are on different pathways, but the pathways share
a set of genes. Gene 2 3 have level-2 voice chains.
In order to trace the genetic links between a microdeletion syndrome and voice, we
ﬁrst attempt to identify voice chains of different lengths that link to the genes in the
microdeletion region. For this, we must ﬁnd voice chains that link the FOXP2 gene to
the syndrome, and identify the speciﬁc genes from the syndrome through which they are
linked. We do so using the graph-search algorithm described below.
From our perspective, a biological pathway Bis represented by the set of genes it
involves B  {g gis a gene in the speciﬁed pathway }. Two pathways,B andB2, are
linked if there are genes that are common to both pathways, i.e., B1 2   . Thus, the set
of all pathways can be represented as a graph where the nodes are biological pathways,
and two nodes are linked only if the corresponding pathways have common genes, as
illustrated in Figure 2a.
A pathway chain is any non-repeating sequence of pathways B B B3 1   andBi  Bjfori  j, i.e., where every pair of adjacent pathways has
common genes, and there are no closed loops in the chain. In terms of the graph (see
Figure 2a ), a pathway chain is any path between any two nodes in the graph. A voice chain

is the number of nodes αin the chain, not counting the terminal node S. For the purpose
of this paper, we will assume Sto be the set of genes in a microdeletion region associated
with a syndrome. Thus, S {g gis a gene in the microdeletion region }. All voice chains
of length αform the set of level- αvoice chains, and the chainlink genes that connect Sto
the level- αvoice chains form the chainlink set VNα.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 7 33

biological pathways. Each node in this graph represents a biological pathway. The genes githat
contribute to each pathway are listed within the node. Nodes are linked to each other through edges
that represent the set of shared genes. If two nodes have no gene in common, no edge exists between
them. Genes that link pathways (nodes) are explicitly shown on the edges. ( b)  Explains what a
chainlink gene means in the context of a microdeletion region and the target voice gene (FOXP2 in
the example used in this paper). To compose voice chains, the set of genes of interest (e.g., from a
microdeletion region) is added to the a graph as a node (shaded pink). The  chainlink  genes that
link the set to the graph are also shown. The topmost (left) node represents a biological pathway
that contains the FOXP2 gene ( g1, highlighted in yellow). ( c) A Level-1 voice chain is the edge
shown in red. The  chainlink  gene g that links the set (in pink) to the voice chain is also shown.

To ﬁnd voice chains of the form BV,B1,   S arising from the microdeletion region
S(which we will refer to as the  syndrome  for brevity), we introduce the microdeletion
region in the pathway graph (Figure 2b). Voice chains are now the paths from BVtoS
(Figure 2c,d). A breadth-ﬁrst algorithm, described in Algorithm 1, is used to extract the
chainlink setsVNαfor voice chains of multiple levels. The outcome of the algorithm is theEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 8 33
set of chainlink genes VNα[S]that connect each syndrome Sto voice chains of level α, for
1 α 2. We restrict ourselves to chains of lengths of up to 2 since, at greater lengths, the
chained inﬂuences cannot be disambiguated, as indicated by prior studies in the (highly
related) context of protein protein interactomes, e.g., [ 3]. Another reason for restricting
ourselves to level 2 chains is that for the speciﬁc example chosen in this paper, there are
not enough data that allow us to build deeper chains meaningfully (without resorting to
self-loops, which may lead to incorrect conclusions).

2.2. Ensemble Analysis
In the methodology we propose, for any microdeletion region S, we derive the set of
chainlink genes within it for which α-level chains exist. The size and composition of this
set can then be used in conjunction with the level of the voice chain to indicate the effect onEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 9 33
voice (in a later analysis). In general, we can work with any level- αvoice chains in such an
analysis  however, we restrict ourselves to α 1 and α 2.
3. Analysis
VNα,where α 1, 2, were computed for a total of 82 1 20/22/X,Y. Genomic information, including gene names, was obtained
from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee s (HGNC) human genome database,
comprising 42,764 3245 gene families and sets as of the
time of conducting this analysis. Information about the phenotypes and the speciﬁc
genes implicated in a syndrome was obtained from a survey of the current literature on
medical genetics and genomics and from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)
repository for authoritative information about human genes and genetic phenotypes.
The FOXP2 gene chosen for this analysis has been strongly implicated in speech and
language disorders [ 4,5], including monogenic speech disorders. The cytogenetic location
(chromosome locus) of this gene is 7 31.1. Mutations in this gene are known to cause speech
and language disorder Type 1, also called  Autosomal dominant speech and language
disorder with orofacial dyspraxia . The phenotype description and known molecular basis
for this disorder can be found under OMIM entry SPCH1 602081. The FOXP2 2  [ 6]. This protein is a transcription factor  it
controls the activity of other genes. It binds to the DNA of the genes that it controls through
a region known as a Forkhead Domain. It thus plays a critical role in several protein-coding
and other biological pathways and has been well studied [ 7]. A more detailed summary of
this gene can be obtained from the Human Protein Atlas [8].
The ensemble of pathways used for this analysis was obtained from the Carcinogenic
Potency Database (CPDB), described on its website as  a single standardized resource of
the results of 45 years of chronic, long-term carcinogenesis bioassays . Its current database
of human biological pathways contains 4319 pathways and their gene compositions. This
database has been used extensively in the medical literature and was chosen in this case
for illustrative purposes since there is (importantly) no inherent bias towards the speech
phenotype in it. In this database, there is only one pathway that contains the gene FOXP2.
This is the Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) pathway, which contains 63 genes, listed
below for reference

4. Inferences
A wealth of conclusions can be drawn from Table 1 (and from its more detailed version,
Table A1 in Appendix A). However, we focus only on those that help validate the usefulness
of the proposed algorithm.
4.1. Voice Chains as Predictors of Speech Characteristics
Of the 76 1, voice chains were found to exist for all. By our
hypothesis, this would imply that in all cases, there is a potential for voice to be affected. The
syndromes 15 11 13 28 have two versions each, divided in the medical literature
based on symptoms, rather than gene composition of the microdeletion region. We can
therefore combine them for analysis, leaving us with 74 syndromes to be analyzed. For
the syndrome 16 22, no information about the speech issues was found in the medical
literature. Only the remaining 73 syndromes are considered in the analysis below.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 13 33
The incidence of speech pathologies (including allforms of pathologies) among the
general population is reported to be about 5% [ 65], and between 2.3% and 24.6% among
children [ 66]. Of the 73 syndromes, 17 syndromes had both level-1 and level-2 voice chains,
while 56 had only level-2 chains. The occurrence of speech aberrations was reported for all
17 syndromes with level-1 6 56 syndromes with only level-2
voice chains. Thus, voice chains correlate highly with the existence of speech anomalies.
4.2. Voice Chains as Information-Carrying Entities
Let us study how voice chains correlate with the presence or absence of speciﬁc voice
problems . Such correlations would show that voice chains carry information about how the
voice may be affected. This information is expected to be coarse-grained since we only take
the presence or absence of any gene into consideration and consider no other cytogenetic
information related to it.
From Table A1, we observe the following.
Level-1 chains 
The number of level-1 1 2 in all cases and is not
amenable to statistical analysis. However, we make the following observations 
1. Level-1 voice chains co-occur with speech problems 100% of the time.
2. For all instances where level-1 voice chains are present, severe symptoms occur 100%
of the time (impaired, delayed or absent speech).
3. For all instances of syndromes with no effect on speech (i.e., where normal is not just
one of a range of other speech symptoms), level-1 100% of the the
time.
Level-2 Chains 
Level-2 voice chains are present in all cases and co-occur with speech disorders in all
but 6 cases  thus, in only 6 cases has speech been reported to be normal. Therefore, level-2
voice chains co-occur with speech problems 91.8% of the time.
We note that a syndrome may have level-2 voice chains through many chainlink genes,
which could number in the tens or even hundreds. Each of the chainlink genes could, in
turn, also be associated with multiple other pathways, in addition to the one connecting it
to FOXP2. We refer to the total number of pathways that include the chainlink genes of a
syndrome as its  chainlink connectivity .
Table 2 presents some statistics of syndromes, chainlink genes, and chainlink connectivity
 associated with speech disorders of different severity.The problems considered are 
absent speech (the most severe symptom), impaired speech (a symptom that is less severe
than absent), delayed speech (a cognitive symptom that is also less severe than absent and
comparable in severity to impaired speech a physical symptom), dysarthric speech (a
symptom related to physical issues), and apraxic speech (due to CNS disorders  this is less
severe compared to absent speech and often subsumes idiosyncratic speech). Each row
of the table represents one type of speech problem and shows the number of syndromes
associated with it, the mean and median of the counts of chainlink genes for the syndromes,
and the mean and median of the chainlink connectivities of the syndromes. From an
inspection of Table 2, a distinct pattern emerges. Rank ordering the symptoms by ascending
order of the means of the counts of chainlink genes, we see that their connectivities also fall
in almost the same order 
normal (32, 404 ) apraxia (43, 675 ) dysarthria (43, 725 ) impaired (46, 734 )(1)
 delayed (47, 682 ) absent (60, 902 )
This rank ordering is consistent with the rank ordering of symptom severity based on
the descriptions in the medical literature. In general, statistically speaking, the number of
chainlink genes and the chainlink connectivity both appear to relate monotonically to the
severity of the speech disorder.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 14 33 2. Row-wise  Statistics showing the number of syndromes (count) associated with each voice

scatter of chainlink gene counts vs. normalized (per-chainlink-gene) chainlink connectivity
for different severities of voice problems. Once again, it is apparent from the ﬁgures
that the distributions of chainlink counts and chainlink connectivity is predictive of the
type of speech problem. In particular, as is evident from Figure 3c, the distribution for
normal speech stands out distinctly, as does that for absent speech, although the latter is
not as distinctive as the former. Among the other levels, the distributions for apraxic and
dysarthric speech appear similar, and so also do those for impaired and delayed speech
appear similar.
In order to quantify these differences, we modeled the distributions of chainlink counts
and chainlink connectivities for the different severity levels. These distributions have
the general characteristics of over-dispersed Poisson distributions and can be modelled
as Conway Maxwell Poisson (CMP) distributions [ 67]. The CMP distribution is a twoparameter
 exponential-family PMF over non-negative integers that takes the form
P(n)  λn
(n )ν1
Z(λ,ν)(2)
where λ,ν 0are the parameters of the distribution. Given a set of integers, λand νcan
be obtained through a maximum likelihood estimator [68].
Figure 4 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the probability distributions
of chainlink counts (Figure 4a) and connectivities (Figure 4b) for syndromes associated
with speech problems of different severity levels. These, too, follow the visible trends of
Figure 3 , where the distributions of both chainlink counts and chainlink connectivities for
syndromes associated with the two extreme conditions, normal and absent speech, are
distinct from those for other types of problems.
To quantify the differences in the distributions, we deﬁne the code distance between
two sets of integers Ci {n1,   ,ni}and Cj {m1,   ,mj}as the excess number of bits
required to encode them if each set is encoded using the optimal code for the other set
rather than itself.
D(Pi,Pj)   
n Cilog2(Pj(n)
Pi(n))
  
n Cjlog2(
Pi(n)
Pj(n))
(3)
where Pi()and Pj()are the estimates of the PMFs for Ciand Cj, respectively. In our case, we
choose the maximum likelihood estimates of the CMP distributions for the sets to compute
this metric.
Table 3a shows the code distances between the chainlink counts for different types
of speech problems. Table 3b shows the same for their chainlink connectivities. In both
cases, we observe that the distributions for normal speech stand clearly apart from those
for the other types of speech problems. The distributions for fully absent speech, too, are
distinctive from those for other problem types. Among apraxic, dysarthric, impaired, andEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 15 33
delayed speech, the differences between the distributions of adjacent degrees of severity
is minimal  however, the distances show a distinct increasing trend with increases in the
degree of impairment.

Overall, from the above analysis, the properties of the level-2 chains of a syndrome
appear predictive of the degree of the speech problems associated with it. Our analysis has
considered the chainlink counts and connectivities indpendently, and each of them shows
this behavior. A joint analysis of both may show stronger dependencies.
Most importantly, note that in all of the analysis above, we have ignored the secondary
effects of other issues, such as intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, a highly
simplifying assumption. A more correct information measure that takes these into account
is expected to show even stronger relationships between the level and degree of connectivity
of a syndrome to the FOXP2 pathway and its effect on speech.
4.3. Why Are There No Instances of Missing Voice Chains 
Are voice chains redundant  The fact that there are no missing voice chains is easily
explainable. The reason is linked to the size of the syndromic regions. To understand this,
consider the following facts.
Our database comprises 4319 unique pathways. A total of 1205 2 gene, and collectively, these include
11,746 genes. Thus, a randomly chosen gene from the entire human genome of 42.7k genes
(as in the HGNC Human Genome database) has a 27.5% chance of being on a pathway that
links to the FOXP2 containing pathway, i.e., of being a level-2 chainlink gene.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 17 33
The shortest microdeletion considered (2 23.1) includes 9 genes, each of which has
a 27% chance of being a level-2 chainlink gene. The syndrome itself then has a 94.44%
probability of having a level-2 voice chain purely by chance. The second shortest pathway
includes 26 99.98% probability of having a level-2 voice chain by chance.
The remaining pathways are larger (in terms of the number of genes), and it is virtually
impossible for them notto have a level-2 chain.
As a result, it is realistic to expect that, as a consequence of the density with which the
FOXP2 containing pathway is linked to other pathways, any syndrome arising from genetic
aberrations that includes even a moderately sized set of genes will have an effect on voice . It remains
a plausible hypothesis that any factor that inﬂuences gene function has at least some chance
to ultimately affect voice for example, at least a 27% chance within the boundaries of the
example presented in this paper.
The above argument assumes that the genes in a microdeletion region are randomly
chosen. The mean of the fraction of genes in a microdeletion that appears in any voice
chain is observed to be 28.79% with a variance of 0.014, indicating concordance with the
assumption of randomness. A secondary implication is that the likelihood of adjacent
genes in the same cytogenetic region to be chainlink genes is independent of one another.
4.4. Ancillary Observations
Some important ancillary observations emerge from this study, which may be important
 to note. These are mentioned brieﬂy below.
1. For each syndrome, some genes have been identiﬁed as largely important i.e., these
areimplicated largely for the syndrome s effect on the individual. Of the syndromes for
which there is information about implicated genes, we see that in only 8 syndromes
(2 16.1 15, 2 23.1, 9 24.3, 11 23, 13 12.3, 17 23.1 23.2, 19 13.13, and Yq11), none
of the implicated genes appear in the two levels of voice chains shown. In all other
cases, the implicated genes impact FOXP2 pathways and are likely to have a bearing
on speech anomalies. We have noted earlier that FOXP2 is not the only gene known
to be related to voice production. If we had chosen some other gene as an example in
this paper (instead of FOXP2), it is likely that the implicated genes for the 8 exceptions
mentioned above would appear as chainlink genes (while some others may not). This
hypothesis can be easily tested in corresponding experiments.
2. Identifying candidate genes for further investigation  Using only chainlink genes
that appear on level-1 chains as illustrative examples (see Table A1 in the Appendix A
for reference), we see that voice chains can be useful in identifying candidate genes
for further investigation in the context of speech issues. Some examples are given
below. The likely candidates are written in parentheses, while the already implicated
genes are indicated in bold 
  1 36 (ARID A)  Although not implicated for this syndrome in studies so far,
ARID A is located in 1 36.11, a region frequently deleted in human cancers [ 69].
Disruption in its function may lead to the co-occurrence of oncological and
speech issues. This hypothesis is veriﬁable.
  5 35.3 ( NSD1 )  The gene NSD1 appears in a level-1 chain and is also an implicated
 gene. Ideally, this should not be a candidate for further investigation.
However, paradoxically, while effects on speech are expected, the literature reports
 normal speech for some subjects for this case. This may be a result of
biased sampling (the more severe cases may not be conducive to life due to other
concurrent severe symptoms, which is a common occurrence in microdeletion
syndromes  in some cases, only mosaic individuals survive). This warrants some
investigation.
  11 15.5 (HRAS)  Although not implicated, and although two studies cited under
OMIM  130650 for this syndrome explicitly mention HRAS as notsigniﬁcant,
HRAS has nevertheless been independently found to be extremely signiﬁcant
in RASopathy and cancer studies, e.g., [ 70]. Its role in this syndrome needs toEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 18 33
be re-evaluated given its inﬂuence on 347 biological pathways and its strong
inﬂuence on speech.
  16 11.2 16 12.2 16 11.2 (SRCAP)  Although not implicated, it connects to
only one other pathway in the ensemble, and that is the ACC pathway of FOXP2.
The effects on speech are expected to be strong if this gene is aberrant. This gene
may be implicated in further investigations.
  17 13.1 (KDM B)  Speech is absent in this syndrome. The gene TP53 is implicated,
 which also appears at level-1 206 pathways. KDM B
is the only other gene in the level-1 8 other
pathways. It is likely that this gene also plays a strong role in inﬂuencing speech
and merits investigation.
  17 12 (ERBB2)  The gene ERBB2 124 pathways. It is a wellknown
 oncogene [ 71], in that perturbations in its function have been observed
to have deleterious effects. If it is also connected to FOXP2, then its appearance
in the voice chain allows a surprising hypothesis that biomarkers of some
oncological conditions may also be present in voice.
  19 13.3 (MAP K2,UHRF1)  MAP K2 1 are not implicated. However
their appearance as level-1 chainlink genes warrants investigation, especially for
MAP K2, which inﬂuences 257 pathways. Prompted by this, a literature search
did reveal that MAP K2 hasbeen implicated in this syndrome recently [ 72],
although this is not on the OMIM records, which were largely consulted for this
study.
  22 13.3 (BRD1)  The gene BRD1 9 pathways
only, but the effect on speech is severe in this syndrome. This warrants the investigation
 of BRD1 independently in relation to speech characteristics. A literature
search reveals that BRD1 is indeed strongly associated with brain development
and susceptibility to both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder [ 73], and
consequent effects on speech are highly likely.
  Xp11.22 (SMC A)  Although SMC A is not implicated, it appears in 33 pathways.
The speech issues are severe and the gene warrants investigation for this effect. A
recent report in the literature has implicated it in severe intellectual disability and
therapy-resistant epilepsy in females [ 74]. The former is known to be associated
with severe speech anomalies.
  Xp11.3 (KDM A)  Although not implicated, KDM A warrants investigation. In
the literature, it is independently known to be associated with delayed speech
and psychomotor development [75].
3. Expression of speech characteristics  The observation that deletions of genes on all
chromosomes ultimately results in the expression of speech anomalies carries signiﬁcance.
 From a much broader perspective, this suggests that the effect on speech may
be supported by the action of multiple concurrent biological pathways. There may be
no single gene or genes (on select chromosomes) that may code for speech capabilities
per se, and FOXP2 may be one of a few genes that may consolidate and regulate the
speech- and language-related emergent effects. It may be that genes directly code for
structural elements in the range of phenotypes, while other properties, such as speech
and language abilities, are emergent from the coordination of these (and epigenetic)
factors.
A more prosaic argument for this can also be presented. Within the ensemble of
syndromes analyzed, there are three kinds of of cause-and-effect relationships  (a) syndromes
 with physical structures of the vocal tract (e.g., craniofacial anomalies that
include cleft palate, changes in lip shape, etc.), which adversely affect the biomechanical
 aspects of voice and speech production, (b) syndromes in which auditory and
motor functions are compromised, and (c) syndromes that affect the normal functions
of the brain, causing cognitive, learning, memory, and other issues that are, in turn,
likely to lead to speech problems. In no case do we see only speech aberrations inEntropy 2023 ,25, 897 19 33
isolation of these factors. The associations between speech and other expressed factors
have, in fact, been ubiquitously observed, e.g., [ 48]. This may support the hypothesis
that speech abilities are likely to be emergent from an ensemble of factors (including
other phenotypes), rather than expressed directly by any  speech  gene.
5. Conclusions
The hypothesis that the existence of voice chains is correlated with speech characteristics
 is adequately validated by the statistical analysis presented in this paper. The analysis
presented in this paper, in fact, also shows that the level of voice chains is correlated positively
 with the severity of speech problems. Based on this, a simple information measure
has been suggested to rank-order the effects of speciﬁc sets of voice chains on speech. We
also see how the methodology presented can potentially provide leads to speciﬁc genes that
might be candidates for further investigation in the context of speech issues and microdeletion
 syndromes. While the example of chromosomal microdeletion syndromes used for
this paper is very speciﬁc, the methodology itself may be easily generalized and extended
to reveal the potential effects of other diseases with a genetic basis and of other factors that
inﬂuence gene function in some manner on speech, voice and (in further reﬁnements of the
analysis) their speciﬁc qualities and characterisitcs. As a speciﬁc suggestion, one exercise
that would allow for a more comprehensive analysis would be to explore the entire human
genome database to identify which genes are connected via voice chains (and to what level),
as well as whether or not there have been corresponding effects on voice reported in the
biomedical literature. In cases where large amounts of data are available, one could also
explore such connections in an entirely data-driven manner, using AI-based biomarker
discovery mechanisms.

Appendix A
This table lists the voice chains found for a set of 76 documented microdeletion
syndromes. This range excludes chromosome 21, for which sufﬁcient documentation was
not found in the literature. The analysis was conducted for voice chains up to level 2. The
format of each row in this table is as follows 
First column 
  In each row, the top left entry is the microdeletion syndrome.
  Below this, on the left, is the OMIM record for the cytogenetic region of the syndrome.
  Below the OMOM record, the common names by which the syndrome is referred to in
the medical literature are listed.
  Below the list of common names, sets of chainlink genes that form level-1 2
 voice chains (denoted as {VN1}and{VN2}) respectively, found by the proposed
algorithm are listed. These sets are listed only if they are present.
  For each voice chain listed, the ﬁrst entry denotes the level of the voice chain. Following
 this is the list of chainlink genes that belong to the corresponding microdeletion
region, which are linked to FOXP2 through the corresponding voice chain level.Entropy 2023 ,25, 897 20 33
  For each gene, the number of pathways that a gene connects to (in general, inclusive
of connections to the ACC pathway of FOXP2) is written as its subscript.
  All chainlink genes are not named. For brevity, the ﬁrst 10 genes with the greatest
number of links are listed, and the total number of the rest of the genes (total chainlink
gene count) is indicated. At the end, the genes with a single pathway link are explicitly
listed. They are included in the total chainlink gene count mentioned above. Thus,
for example, the level-2 2 16.1 15 17, including all genes that are explicitly listed in the table.
  In each row, the genes in the voice chains that have been implicated for the syndrome s
phenotypic expression in prior studies are shown in parentheses on the top right.
The genes that are also present as chainlink genes in the voicechains found for the
syndrome are shown in bold font.
Second column 
  The second column in this table lists the corresponding speech characteristics, with
references. Where no reference is cited, the information is found in the OMIM record
for the syndrome (where possible, OMIM references are used for brevity).
Table A1. Chainlink genes for level-1 and level-2 76 chromosomal microdeletion
 syndromes. Each chain forms a link from the gene shown to the ACC biological pathway
of FOXP2 and has been automatically derived. The total number of pathways that each gene inﬂuences
 independently is shown as a subscript to its name. Observed phenotypic effects on speech are
given in the last column. When references are not cited, the information reﬂects that in the OMIM
records for the syndrome.
