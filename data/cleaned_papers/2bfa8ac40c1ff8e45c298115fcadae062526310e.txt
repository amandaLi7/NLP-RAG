Abstract: The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and veri ed against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5 is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a decrease in fatigue life. Keywords: bridge engineering; high-performance steel; fatigue crack; numerical simulation; stress Bridge structures are developing in the direction of large span, high load, light weight, and environmental protection [ 1]. The performance of steel is also improving with the increasing demands of engineering construction, resulting in high-performance steel for bridges [ 2,3]. Compared to ordinary steel, high-performance steel (HPS) shows higher strength, higher fracture toughness, and better fatigue resistance [ 4 7]. As a result, HPS is widely used in various steel bridges [ 8], such as the sea-crossing bridge, Akashi Long-term stress fatigue often leads to structural fracture failure during the service life of steel bridges [ 9 12]. Zong et al. [ 13] conducted an experimental study on the fatigue crack growth rate of Q345qD bridge steel by changing its thicknesses and stress ratios. The results showed that the crack growth rate increased with the stress ratio, and the crack growth rate increased by 7 25%, but the in uence of plate thickness change was not noticeable. Liu et al. [ 14] studied the relationship between the thickness and the stress state of the crack, quanti ed the thickness effect, and introduced the penetrating crack, but how the thickness affects the stress intensity factor of the crack tip was not clearly pointed out [ 15]. Li et al. [ 16] carried out a study on the in uence of different surface crack directions on Metals 2023 ,13, 1496. https://doi.org/10.3390/met13081496 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metalsMetals 2023 ,13, 1496 2 of 18 the change in stress intensity factor during bearing operation. Yaagoubi and Meier [ 17] studied the relationship between surface cracks with different angles and the J-integral, and they showed that the increase in friction effect in the case of oblique cracks weakened the J-integral at the crack tip. But there has been no in-depth study on penetrating cracks, which are more harmful to the structure; these will be studied in this paper for HPS steel. Although the effective initial crack in the process of crack propagation is very short, it is extremely destructive since there are some invisible initial cracks. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake in-depth study on the crack depth ratio. Meanwhile, most scholars have focused on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of ordinary steel beams [ 18,19], and there have been insuf cient investigations on fatigue crack failure of high-performance steel. Kang and Hong [ 20] studied the fatigue properties of HPS, and their results showed that the fatigue strength of Q690D HPS was signi cantly higher than existing speci cations. It is known that the joint action of a corrosive environment and repeated stress is one of the main reasons for the premature failure of most engineering metals, especially in marine environments [ 21,22]. This usually leads to the premature initiation of fatigue cracks on the surface of materials, resulting in reductions in fatigue life and resistance [ 23 25]. The research on the crack growth rate of different kinds of steels is extensive [ 26], but the driving factors affecting the crack growth rate of HPS are not well understood [ 27 29]. The effects of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting have not attracted enough attention, but they are very important for the fatigue safety of high-performance steel structures [ 30]. These limited investigations have led to fatigue safety problems in high-performance steel structures. To investigate the behaviour of fatigue crack propagation, a  nite element model of a CT specimen of Q550E HPS is established and veri ed against experimental results in this paper. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pit on crack propagation are studied. This research provides a reliable and practical basis for the theoretical analysis of prefabricated cracks and an anti-fatigue design, which promotes the application of HPS in sea-crossing bridges. 2. Experimental Program Q550E with a thickness of 8 mm was used in the experiment, and Q235 specimens were also made for comparison. The chemical compositions of the steels are shown in Table 1. In order to obtain accurate material parameters of the tensile mechanical properties of the steel, uniaxial tensile tests were carried out before the fatigue crack propagation experiments, and the test results are shown in Table 2.

Compared with the curves for the intactMetals 2023 ,13, 1496 5 of 18 specimens, the presence of turning points in these curves is due to the obvious stress concentration when the crack tip extends to the vicinity of the corrosion pit, which leads to a sudden increase in stress at the crack tip, thus accelerating the crack propagation.

When the crack growth length reaches 12 mm, the crack reaches the edge of the corrosion pit, and the crack growth rate then suddenly changes and enters Stage II.

Numerical Investigations 4.1. Finite Element Model A  nite element model was developed by using the commercial software ANSYS workbench. The specimen size, material parameters, and load of the  nite element model were consistent with those of the crack propagation test. A tetrahedral mesh and Solid185 elements were adopted, and the overall mesh accuracy was set to 1.5 mm. For a more realistic simulation and considering the requirements of time and accuracy, an in uence ball with a radius of 6 mm and a mesh precision of 0.4 mm was set at the crack tip for mesh re nement, as shown in Figure 8. Smart crack growth simulation was adopted in the mesh processing. This process is based on mesh division that simulates the features of fatigue or crack growth morphology in engineering structures, representing separation, deformation, adaptation, and re-division technology. To simulate static or dynamic fatigue crack growth in the solution process, the in uence of the crack tip stress singularity on the crack growth rate can be effectively alleviated. Because the grid changes occur at the crack front, the stress state at the crack tip can be well represented in the process of crack propagation, and the high stress intensity factor at the crack tip caused by rough grid division can be avoided.

Initial Crack Angle To study the effect of the initial crack angle on the crack propagation, initial cracks at four angles of 0 , 30 , 45 , and 60 were prefabricated on the specimens in this study. The initial crack length was 1.5 mm with a 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at different angles were the same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles are in the range of0 45 , but they change signi cantly at 60 . Thus, there is a critical angle of crack propagation. An encrypted approximation at 45 60 was carried out. It was found that the critical angle was 52.5 , where the crack growth rate suddenly changed. According to theK N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity factor caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and the reduction range is as high as 59%. Therefore, an initial crack angle of 0 is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The initial crack angle has little effect on the K arelationship.Metals 2023 ,13, 1496 9 of 18 Metals 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 18 Figure 10.

The K values increase with the crack depth ratio, which leads to a higher possibility of crack tip fracture. In engineering practice, the e  ective crack length. i.e., the sum of the notch depth and crack length, must be monitored to detect these hidden cracks. Figure 13.

Previous studies have shown that stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 can well demonstrate the e  ect of stress ratios on crack propagation [24]. For this reason, these stress ratios with a thickness of 10 mm and a load of 36 kN  were used in the FEM to study the relationship between the crack propagation length, cycle times, and the K value. As shown in Figure 14, whether the steel is co rroded or not, the stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor. The curves of corroded specimens  uctuated and experienced a sharp slow sharp growth process. This is because the e  ective length of the crack tip decreases when the crack propagation length is about to reach th e corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden increase in crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate. Figure 13. Stress diagram of crack propagation with different crack depth ratios of ( A) 0.2, ( B) 0.25, (C) 0.3, ( D) 0.35, ( E) 0.4, and ( F) 0.45. Previous studies have shown that stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 can well demonstrate the effect of stress ratios on crack propagation [ 24]. For this reason, these stress ratios with a thickness of 10 mm and a load of 36 kN were used in the FEM to study the relationship between the crack propagation length, cycle times, and the Kvalue. As shown in Figure 14, whether the steel is corroded or not, the stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor. The curves of corroded specimens  uctuated and experienced a sharp slow sharp growth process. This is because the effective length of the crack tip decreases when the crack propagation length is about to reach the corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden increase in crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate. According to ASTM E647-15, the thickness B of the CT specimen should be between W 20 and W  4. Considering the information in the related literature [ 24], steel samples with thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm with a load of 7 kN and a stress ratio of 0.1 were used to study the effect of thickness on the crack propagation. As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in the K arelationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When the thickness was 10mm, the variation in Kwas the lowest, and the extreme difference occurred at 595.18 MPa mm1/2. For the K N curves, the stress intensity factors at the initial fractureMetals 2023 ,13, 1496 13 of 18 of the crack tip for these thicknesses were 923.96 MPa mm1/2, 589.01 MPa mm1/2, and 482.32 MPa mm1/2, respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 mm to 5 mm led to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly when the thickness reached 8 mm and 10 mm were roughly 133,761 and 335,330, respectively. This indicates that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears when the thickness is greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually increases, that is, the steel is less likely to fracture. In the a N relationship, increasing the thickness resulted in a lower crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the extension length decreases as the thickness increases. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the Kvalue of the crack tip at the stress concentration position reaches a maximum. Combined with the theoretical formula forK, the thickness affects Kin the crack propagation area and signi cantly affects the crack growth rate. The stress intensity factor changes little in the early stage of crack propagation, but it changes obviously in the later stage. Metals 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 18 Figure 14.

Studies have shown that there are many forms of corrosion pit, such as conical, cylindrical, elliptical, and hemispherical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits are the most widely used [ 32]. Therefore, a hemispherical corrosion pit with a radius of 2 mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [ 31]. The sine wave continuous load reduction method was adopted to prefabricate an initial 2 mm fatigue crack. The data of the  rst 2 mm of the initial crack are relatively discrete in the formal propagation process; thus, the centre of the pit was positioned 4 mm away from the crack tip of the specimen. The effects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were analysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely, As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the corrosion pits do not affect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches the edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack propagation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bottom of the pit, the crack propagation rate increases signi cantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has little effect on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm), and the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the crack passes through the corrosion pit. The maximum difference in fatigue life was 29,252 times when passing through the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life.Metals 2023 ,13, 1496 14 of 18 Metals 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 18 Figure 15.

Corrosion Pi tting Based on the research described above, a corrosion pit was prefabricated on the crack propagation line. Studies have shown that there are many forms of corrosion pit, such as conical, cylindrical, elliptical, and hemisphe rical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits are the most widely used [32].

The e  ects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were analysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1). As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the corrosion pits do not a  ect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches the edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack propagation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bo ttom of the pit, the crack propagation rate increases signi  cantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has li ttle e ect on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm), and the fatigue life of the sp ecimen is obviously di  erent when the crack passes through the corrosion pit. The maximum di  erence in fatigue life was 29, 252 times when passing through the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life. Figure 16. a N curves of di  erent corrosion pit depths. Since the crack growth rate for the case wi th a depth of 0.75 B was the fastest, the change in K along the crack propagation direction wa s further studied. As shown in Figure 17, stress  uctuation occurs when the crack propag ates to the vicinity of the pit bo ttom because of the in  uence of stress singularity. However, the K value of the crack tip at the bottom of the corrosion pit is always signi  cantly higher than the value at both ends. The crack propagation rate reaches its maximum when it propagates to the bo ttom of the pit. From the perspective of the whole crack tip sect ion, when the crack tip extends to the left edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is di  erent from the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen. This shows that the Figure 16. a Ncurves of different corrosion pit depths.

It shows that the K value of the crack tip gradually decreases from the side with the corrosion pit (from 2 or 1 in Figure 17) to the other side, and the stress is still the highest near the pit.

In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel was experimentally investigated. The fa tigue crack growth performance of Q550 was compared with that of Q235. The e  ects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pi tting, on crack propagation were numerically studied. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. The crack growth rate of Q550E is obviously higher than that of Q235 in the late stage of crack growth. The crack propagation life of Q550E is reduced by about 18% when corroded, as compared to intact specimens.  The crack growth curve associated with corrosion pi tting is divided into three stages, but it has li ttle in  uence on the crack 2. A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher K value, which, in turn, a  ects the structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5 , and K is signi  cantly a ected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is exceeded. When the initial crack angle is 0 , the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are Figure 17. The stress state of the crack tip for the pit at a depth of 0.75 B.

When the initial crack angle is 0 , the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are most likely to occur. Otherwise, the crack initiation angle tends to expand perpendicular to the load direction. 3. The stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor. The thickness has an obvious impact on the Kvalue in the crack propagation area and signi cantly affects the crack growth rate. 4. The presence of a corrosion pit has little effect on crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit, but the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the crack passes through the corrosion pit. The corrosion pit around the crack propagation surface reaches the yield state  rst, and the Kvalue around the corrosion pit gradually decreases along the thickness direction. It should be noted that these  ndings are based on limited experimental and numerical results. The comprehensive in uence of these parameters needs to be veri ed and quanti ed to further promote the application of Q550E in sea-crossing bridges. Therefore, more studies are required to develop a fatigue life model with consideration of these parameters for the guidance of HPS service performance evaluation in marine environments.
