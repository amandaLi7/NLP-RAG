Abstract  The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied
in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the
results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and veriﬁed
against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio,
thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed.
The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it
did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain
value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q E. The initial crack angle of 52.5 is
the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio
increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An
increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress
intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually
decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach
the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a
decrease in fatigue life.

1. Introduction
Bridge structures are developing in the direction of large span, high load, light
weight, and environmental protection [ 1]. The performance of steel is also improving
with the increasing demands of engineering construction, resulting in high-performance
steel for bridges [ 2,3]. Compared to ordinary steel, high-performance steel (HPS) shows
higher strength, higher fracture toughness, and better fatigue resistance [ 4 7]. As a result,
HPS is widely used in various steel bridges [ 8], such as the sea-crossing bridge, Akashi
Kaikyo Bridge.
Long-term stress fatigue often leads to structural fracture failure during the service life
of steel bridges [ 9 12]. Zong et al. [ 13] conducted an experimental study on the fatigue crack
growth rate of Q qD bridge steel by changing its thicknesses and stress ratios. The results
showed that the crack growth rate increased with the stress ratio, and the crack growth
rate increased by 7 25%, but the inﬂuence of plate thickness change was not noticeable.
Liu et al. [ 14] studied the relationship between the thickness and the stress state of the
crack, quantiﬁed the thickness effect, and introduced the penetrating crack, but how the
thickness affects the stress intensity factor of the crack tip was not clearly pointed out [ 15].
Li et al. [ 16] carried out a study on the inﬂuence of different surface crack directions on
Metals 2023 ,13, 1496. https //doi.org/10.3390/met13081496 https //www.mdpi.com/journal/metalsMetals 2023 ,13, 1496 2 18
the change in stress intensity factor during bearing operation. Yaagoubi and Meier [ 17]
studied the relationship between surface cracks with different angles and the J-integral,
and they showed that the increase in friction effect in the case of oblique cracks weakened
the J-integral at the crack tip. But there has been no in-depth study on penetrating cracks,
which are more harmful to the structure  these will be studied in this paper for HPS steel.
Although the effective initial crack in the process of crack propagation is very short, it is
extremely destructive since there are some invisible initial cracks. Therefore, it is necessary
to undertake in-depth study on the crack depth ratio. Meanwhile, most scholars have
focused on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of ordinary steel beams [ 18,19], and
there have been insufﬁcient investigations on fatigue crack failure of high-performance
steel. Kang and Hong [ 20] studied the fatigue properties of HPS, and their results showed
that the fatigue strength of Q D HPS was signiﬁcantly higher than existing speciﬁcations.
It is known that the joint action of a corrosive environment and repeated stress is one
of the main reasons for the premature failure of most engineering metals, especially in
marine environments [ 21,22]. This usually leads to the premature initiation of fatigue cracks
on the surface of materials, resulting in reductions in fatigue life and resistance [ 23 25].
The research on the crack growth rate of different kinds of steels is extensive [ 26], but the
driving factors affecting the crack growth rate of HPS are not well understood [ 27 29]. The
effects of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion
pitting have not attracted enough attention, but they are very important for the fatigue
safety of high-performance steel structures [ 30]. These limited investigations have led to
fatigue safety problems in high-performance steel structures.
To investigate the behaviour of fatigue crack propagation, a ﬁnite element model of
a CT specimen of Q E HPS is established and veriﬁed against experimental results in
this paper. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness,
and corrosion pit on crack propagation are studied. This research provides a reliable and
practical basis for the theoretical analysis of prefabricated cracks and an anti-fatigue design,
which promotes the application of HPS in sea-crossing bridges.

2.1. Specimen Design
Q E with a thickness of 8 mm was used in the experiment, and Q235 specimens
were also made for comparison. The chemical compositions of the steels are shown in
Table 1. In order to obtain accurate material parameters of the tensile mechanical properties
of the steel, uniaxial tensile tests were carried out before the fatigue crack propagation
experiments, and the test results are shown in Table 2.

Three C(T) compact tensile samples for each kind of steel were designed for the fatigue

in accordance with the research of other scholars [ 31], the corrosion pit was a hemisphereMetals 2023 ,13, 1496 3 18 2 mm, positioned 6mm away from the crack tip of the specimen. The

Figure 3 shows the loading device for fatigue crack growth testing. Sine wave loading
with a frequency of 10 Hz was used in the experiment, and the stress ratio was 0.1. A COD
extensometer was placed at the notch to continuously record the opening displacement
during the test, and an industrial camera with  an electron microscope was used to observe
the micro-crack propagation. The opening di splacement of the specimen was measured
by the COD extensometer, and the fatigue cr ack length was calculated using the formula
of the ﬂexibility method. In order to ensure that  the crack tip was sharp enough and not
aﬀected by the initial notch shape of machining, a 1.5 mm crack was prefabricated via
initial machine cu tting. In general, the stress intensity factor K୫ୟ୶ selected for pre-cracking
 was higher than the value in the crack growth rate test. If there was no crack initiation after 30 50 thousand cycles, the K

a sudden increase in stress at the crack tip, thus accelerating the crack propagation. The

stable crack growth. When the crack growth length reaches 12 mm, the crack reaches the
edge of the corrosion pit, and the crack growth rate then suddenly changes and enters
Stage II. When the crack length reaches 16mm, the crack propagation completely passes
through the corrosion pit, and the crack propagation of the specimen reaches a stable
stage. The fatigue crack propagation rate is linearly related to the stress intensity factor
in the logarithmic coordinate system. The crack growth rate of Q E in Zones I and II is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of Q235. Once the crack propagates through the corrosion pit,
the crack propagation rate of Q E is slightly higher.

4.1. Finite Element Model
A ﬁnite element model was developed by using the commercial software ANSYS
workbench. The specimen size, material parameters, and load of the ﬁnite element model
were consistent with those of the crack propagation test. A tetrahedral mesh and Solid185 elements
 were adopted, and the overall mesh accuracy was set to 1.5 mm. For a more realistic
simulation and considering the requirements of time and accuracy, an inﬂuence ball with a
radius of 6 0.4 mm was set at the crack tip for mesh reﬁnement,
as shown in Figure 8. Smart crack growth simulation was adopted in the mesh processing.
This process is based on mesh division that simulates the features of fatigue or crack growth
morphology in engineering structures, representing separation, deformation, adaptation,
and re-division technology. To simulate static or dynamic fatigue crack growth in the
solution process, the inﬂuence of the crack tip stress singularity on the crack growth rate
can be effectively alleviated. Because the grid changes occur at the crack front, the stress
state at the crack tip can be well represented in the process of crack propagation, and the
high stress intensity factor at the crack tip caused by rough grid division can be avoided.

to the grid division of the crack tip, the error of the specimens with corrosion pitting is
relatively high, but the overall error is small, which can truly reﬂect the crack propagation

the experimental value is very close to the simulated value in terms of crack length and

four angles of 0 , 30 , 45 , and 60 were prefabricated on the specimens in this study. The
initial crack length was 1.5 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio
of 0.1.
As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at different angles were the
same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles are in the range
of0 45 , but they change signiﬁcantly at 60 . Thus, there is a critical angle of crack
propagation. An encrypted approximation at 45 60 was carried out. It was found that
the critical angle was 52.5 , where the crack growth rate suddenly changed. According to
theK N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity
factor caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and the reduction range is as high as 59%.
Therefore, an initial crack angle of 0 is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The
initial crack angle has little effect on the K arelationship.Metals 2023 ,13, 1496 9 18 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 18

4.3.1. Initial Crack Angle
To study the e ﬀect of the initial crack angle on the crack propagation, initial cracks at
four angles of 0 , 30 , 45 , and 60  were pref abricated on the specimens in this study. The
initial crack length was 1.5 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio
of 0.1.
As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at di ﬀerent angles were the
same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles  are in the range of
0 45 , but they change signi ﬁcantly at 60 . Thus, there is a critical angle of crack propagation.
 An encrypted approximation at 45 60  was carried out. It was found that the critical
 angle was 52.5 , where the crack growth  rate suddenly changed. According to the K 
N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity factor
caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and th e reduction range is as high as 59%. Therefore,
 an initial crack angle of 0  is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The initial
crack angle has li ttle eﬀect on the K a relationship.

When the crack depth ratio was repeatedly increased by 0.05, the fatigue life decreased by
37%, 39%, 49%, 40%, and 54%. The relationship curve between the stress intensity factor
and crack length was not affected by the crack depth ratio. The change in the stress ratio
did not affect the cracking state under the same crack depth ratio, as shown in Figure 12c.
The ratio of the cracking Kto the stress ratio R was constant for different crack depth ratios,
and the ratio became higher as the depth increased.Metals 2023 ,13, 1496 10 18 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 18

4.3.3. Stress Ratio
Previous studies have shown that stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 can well demonstrate
 the e ﬀect of stress ratios on crack propagation [24]. For this reason, these stress ratios
with a thickness of 10 36 kN  were used in the FEM to study the relationship
 between the crack propagation length, cycle times, and the K value.
As shown in Figure 14, whether the steel is co rroded or not, the stress ratio is directly
proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor.
The curves of corroded specimens ﬂuctuated and experienced a sharp slow sharp
growth process. This is because the e ﬀective length of the crack tip decreases when the
crack propagation length is about to reach th e corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden increase
 in crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate.

The curves of corroded specimens ﬂuctuated and experienced a sharp slow sharp growth
process. This is because the effective length of the crack tip decreases when the crack
propagation length is about to reach the corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden increase in
crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate.
4.3.4. Thickness
According to ASTM E647-15, the thickness B of the CT specimen should be between
W 20 4. Considering the information in the related literature [ 24], steel samples with
thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 7 0.1 were
used to study the effect of thickness on the crack propagation.
As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in the
K arelationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When the
thickness was 10mm, the variation in Kwas the lowest, and the extreme difference occurred
at 595.18 1/2. For the K N curves, the stress intensity factors at the initial fractureMetals 2023 ,13, 1496 13 18 923.96 1/2, 589.01 1/2, and
482.32 1/2, respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 5 mm led
to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly when the thickness
reached 8 10 133,761 335,330, respectively. This indicates
that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears when the thickness is
greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually increases, that is, the steel is
less likely to fracture. In the a N relationship, increasing the thickness resulted in a lower
crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the extension length decreases as the
thickness increases. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the Kvalue of the crack tip at the
stress concentration position reaches a maximum. Combined with the theoretical formula
forK, the thickness affects Kin the crack propagation area and signiﬁcantly affects the crack
growth rate. The stress intensity factor changes little in the early stage of crack propagation,
but it changes obviously in the later stage.

4.3.4. Thickness
According to ASTM E647-15, the thickness B of the CT specimen should be between
W 20 4. Considering the information in the related literature [24], steel samples
with thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 7 0.1
were used to study the e ﬀect of thickness on the crack propagation.
As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in
the K a relationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When
the thickness was 10mm, the variation in K was the lowest, and the extreme di ﬀerence
occurred at 595.18 MPa   mmଵ/ଶ. For the K N curves, the stress intensity factors at the initial
 fracture of the crack tip for these thicknesses were 923.96 MPa   mmଵ/ଶ, 589.01 MPa  
mmଵ/ଶ, and 482.32 MPa   mmଵ/ଶ, respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 5 mm led to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly
when the thickness reached 8 10 133,761 335,330, respectively.
 This indicates that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears
when the thickness is greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually increases,
 that is, the steel is less likely to fracture. In the  a N relationship, increasing the
thickness resulted in a lower crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the extension
 length decreases as the thickness increase s. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the
K value of the crack tip at the stress concen tration position reaches a maximum. Combined
with the theoretical formula for K, the thickness a ﬀects K in the crack propagation area
and signi ﬁcantly aﬀects the crack growth rate. The st ress intensity factor changes li ttle in

4.3.5. Corrosion Pitting
Based on the research described above, a corrosion pit was prefabricated on the crack
propagation line. Studies have shown that there are many forms of corrosion pit, such as
conical, cylindrical, elliptical, and hemispherical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits
are the most widely used [ 32]. Therefore, a hemispherical corrosion pit with a radius
of 2 mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [ 31]. The
sine wave continuous load reduction method was adopted to prefabricate an initial 2 mm
fatigue crack. The data of the ﬁrst 2 mm of the initial crack are relatively discrete in the
formal propagation process  thus, the centre of the pit was positioned 4 mm away from the
crack tip of the specimen. The effects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were
analysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely,
1 1, 2 1, and 3 1).
As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the
corrosion pits do not affect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches
the edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack
propagation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bottom of the pit,
the crack propagation rate increases signiﬁcantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has little
effect on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm),
and the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the crack passes through
the corrosion pit. The maximum difference in fatigue life was 29,252 times when passing
through the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life.Metals 2023 ,13, 1496 14 18 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 18

Based on the research described above, a corrosion pit was prefabricated on the crack
propagation line. Studies have shown that there are many forms of corrosion pit, such as conical, cylindrical, elliptical, and hemisphe rical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits
are the most widely used [32]. Therefore, a he mispherical corrosion pit with a radius of 2
mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [31]. The sine wave

 for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely, 1 1, 2 1, and 3 1).
As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the corrosion
 pits do not a ﬀect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches the
edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack propagation
 length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bo ttom of the pit, the
crack propagation rate increases signi ﬁcantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has li ttle eﬀect
on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm), and the
fatigue life of the sp ecimen is obviously di ﬀerent when the crack passes through the corrosion
 pit. The maximum di ﬀerence in fatigue life was 29, 252 times when passing through
the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life.


Figure 16. a N curves of di ﬀerent corrosion pit depths.
Since the crack growth rate for the case wi th a depth of 0.75 B was the fastest, the
change in K along the crack propagation direction wa s further studied. As shown in Figure
17, stress ﬂuctuation occurs when the crack propag ates to the vicinity of the pit bo ttom
because of the in ﬂuence of stress singularity. However, the K value of the crack tip at the
bottom of the corrosion pit is always signi ﬁcantly higher than the value at both ends. The
crack propagation rate reaches its maximum when it propagates to the bo ttom of the pit.
From the perspective of the whole crack tip sect ion, when the crack tip extends to the left
edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is di ﬀerent from
the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen. This shows that the

In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q E high-performance
steel was experimentally investigated. The fa tigue crack growth performance of Q550 235. The e ﬀects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle,
crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pi tting, on crack propagation were
numerically studied. The main conclusions of this study are as follows 
1. The crack growth rate of Q E is obviously higher than that of Q235 in the late stage
of crack growth. The crack propagation life of Q E is reduced by about 18% when corroded, as compared to intact specimens.  The crack growth curve associated with
corrosion pi tting is divided into three stages, but it has li ttle in ﬂuence on the crack
propagation path.
2. A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher K value, which, in turn, a ﬀects the
structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5 , and K is signi ﬁcantly aﬀected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is exceeded.
When the initial crack angle is 0 , the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are

2. A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher Kvalue, which, in turn, affects
the structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5 ,
and Kis signiﬁcantly affected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is
exceeded. When the initial crack angle is 0 , the crack tip stress is maximized, and
fractures are most likely to occur. Otherwise, the crack initiation angle tends to expand
perpendicular to the load direction.
3. The stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional
to the stress intensity factor. The thickness has an obvious impact on the Kvalue in
the crack propagation area and signiﬁcantly affects the crack growth rate.
4. The presence of a corrosion pit has little effect on crack propagation in the early stage
of the corrosion pit, but the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the
crack passes through the corrosion pit. The corrosion pit around the crack propagation
surface reaches the yield state ﬁrst, and the Kvalue around the corrosion pit gradually
decreases along the thickness direction.
It should be noted that these ﬁndings are based on limited experimental and numerical
results. The comprehensive inﬂuence of these parameters needs to be veriﬁed and quantiﬁed
 to further promote the application of Q E in sea-crossing bridges. Therefore, more
studies are required to develop a fatigue life model with consideration of these parameters
for the guidance of HPS service performance evaluation in marine environments.
