Figurative language permeates human communication,
 but at the same time is relatively understudied
 in NLP. Datasets have been created
 in English to accelerate progress towards
measuring and improving figurative language
processing in language models (LMs). However,
 the use of figurative language is an expression
 of our cultural and societal experiences,
 making it difficult for these phrases to
be universally applicable. In this work, we
create a figurative language inference dataset,
MABL, for seven diverse languages associated
with a variety of cultures  Hindi, Indonesian,
Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili and
Yoruba. Our dataset reveals that each language
relies on cultural and regional concepts for figurative
 expressions, with the highest overlap
between languages originating from the same
region. We assess multilingual LMs  abilities
 to interpret figurative language in zeroshot
 and few-shot settings. All languages exhibit
 a significant deficiency compared to English,
 with variations in performance reflecting
the availability of pre-training and fine-tuning
data, emphasizing the need for LMs to be exposed
 to a broader range of linguistic and cultural
 variation during training.1
When you are feeling happy, do you think that you
are  warm  or  cold   If you are a monolingual
English speaker, you will likely answer  warm ,
and use expressions like  this really warmed my
heart . However, if you are a native Hindi speaker,
you may answer  cold , and use expressions like
ɞदल क  ठ डक पढ़न  ( coldness spreads in one s
heart  ) ( Sharma ,2017 ). Linguistic communication
 often involves figurative (i.e., non-literal) language

Lakoff and Johnson ,1981 ), which is laden with implicit
 cultural references and judgements that vary
cross-culturally. Differences in figurative expressions
 used in different languages may be due to cultural
 values, history, or any number of other factors
that vary across where the languages are spoken.2
Understanding figurative language therefore relies
on understanding what concepts or objects are considered
 culturally significant, as well as their sentiment
Better understanding of figurative language
would benefit tasks such as hate speech detection
 or sentiment classification ( ElSherief et al. ,
2021  van Aken et al. ,2018 ). However, state-ofthe-art
 language models have been shown to frequently
 misinterpret both novel figurative expressions
 and conventionalized idioms, indicating the
need for improved methods ( Dankers et al. ,2022  
2The Hindi example is most likely attributable to climatic conditions,
 as cold may be seen as comparatively more positive
in an area where extreme heat is more common ( Sharma ,
2017 )Liu et al. ,2022 ). Most empirical results probing
language models  abilities with respect to figurative
 language have been based on data in English,
meaning there is a comparative lack of resources
and study in other languages ( Chakrabarty et al. ,
2022  Liu et al. ,2022  Pedinotti et al. ,2021a ).
We find English figurative language datasets
may not have cultural relevance for other languages
 (  2). This is a general challenge in NLP,
as assumptions of common knowledge and important
 topics to talk about vary from culture to culture
 ( Hershcovich et al. ,2022 ). In order to better
 train multilingual models to interpret figurative
 language, as well as to understand linguistic
variation in figurative expressions, we construct
a multilingual dataset, MABL ( Metaphors Across
Borders and Languages), of 6,366 figurative language
 expressions in seven languages (  3). Examples
 are shown in Table 1 .
We use the dataset to conduct a systematic analysis
 of figurative language patterns across languages
 and how well they are captured by current
 multilingual models (  4). We find that figurative
 language is often very culturally-specific, and
makes reference to important entities within a culture,
 such as food, mythology, famous people, or
plants and animals native to specific regions.
We benchmark multilingual model performance
( 5) and analyze model failures (  6), finding that
zero-shot performance of multilingual models is
relatively poor, especially for lower-resource languages.
 According to ( Liu et al. ,2021 ), main factors
 which poses challenges on the performance in
such cases are cross-lingual transfer and concept
shift across languages. However, we observe that
concept shift seems to play a larger role due to culturally
 specific examples. Adding a few examples
in the target language can improve performance
of larger models, but this is more beneficial for
lower-resource languages. This highlights the importance
 of including culturally relevant training
data, particularly data that highlights not just the
existence of a concept, but also how people view
that concept within that culture.
2 Linguistic and Cultural Biases of
Existing Figurative Language Datasets
To confirm the importance of building a multilingual,
 multi-cultural figurative language dataset,
we first performed a pilot study to examine the feasibility
 of instead translating an existing figurative
language dataset, Fig-QA ( Liu et al. ,2022 ), fromLang. fr hi ja
Incorrect 13% 40% 21%
Culturally irrelevant 17% 20% 17%

English into other languages. While there are wellknown
 problems with using translation to create
multilingual datasets for tasks such as QA ( Clark
et al. ,2020 ), it is still worth examining these issues
 in the context of figurative language in particular.
 We used the Google Translate Python API to
translate the development set into languages that
the authors of this paper understood.3These were
French, Japanese, and Hindi. Each annotator annotated
 100 examples for both correctness (whether
or not the translation was accurate), and cultural
relevance (whether or not the expression was one
that would make sense to a native speaker from the
culture where the language is predominant).
As seen in Table 2 , the number of incorrect
 examples is large, particularly for Hindi and
Japanese. This is mainly due to expressions that
don t translate directly (such as a  sharp  conversation
 in English). Culturally irrelevant examples
are due to implicitly assumed knowledge. For instance,
 a crowdworker from the US generated the
example  it s as classic as pancakes for breakfast 
with the meaning  it s very classic . However,
most people from Japan would not see pancakes
as a traditional breakfast, and the meaning  it s not
classic  would be more appropriate.
The shift in topics discussed in cultures associated
 with different languages can be captured by
native speakers familiar with that culture, motivating
 our collection of natural figurative language examples
 from native speakers.
3.1 Language Selection
We choose the following seven languages  Hindi
(hi), Yoruba ( yo), Kannada ( kn), Sundanese ( su),
Swahili ( sw), Indonesian ( id), and Javanese (jv).
The factors we considered while choosing these
languages are as follows  
i)We aimed to include a range of languages
representing the different classes in the resourcebased
 taxonomy of languages, proposed by Joshi
et al. (2020 ), subject to annotator availability.
3https //pypi.org/project/googletrans/Language #Samples
Table 3  Number of collected samples per language.
ii)We chose languages with a sizeable speaker
population as shown in Table 5.
iii)Our languages come from 5 typologically diverse
 language families spoken in 4 different countries,
 which allows us to include a wide range of
linguistic and cultural diversity in our data.
Details about the characteristics of each language
 in terms of available training data and number
 of speakers can be found in Table 5 . Additional
information on linguistic properties of these languages
 can be found in Appendix A .
3.2 Dataset Collection
To create culturally relevant examples, we crowdsourced
 sample collection to two or more native
speakers in the seven languages. The workers were
asked to generate paired metaphors that began with
the same words, but had different meanings, as
well as the literal interpretations of both phrases.
Workers were not discouraged from generating
novel metaphors, but with the caveat that any
examples should be easily understood by native
speakers of that language, e.g.,  it s as classic as
pancakes for breakfast  would not be valid if pancakes
 are not a breakfast food in the country in
which that language is spoken.
Instructions given to annotators can be found in
Appendix B . After collection, each sample was
validated by a separate set of workers who were
fluent in that language. Any examples that were
incoherent, offensive, or did not follow the format
were rejected. The number of samples collected
per language can be seen in Table 3. Examples of
collected data can be seen in Table 1. We note that
because of the limited number of samples in each
language, we view the samples collected as a test
setfor each language, meaning there is no explicit
training set included with this release.4 Dataset Analysis
4.1 Concepts expressed
In the structure mapping theory of metaphor, figurative
 language involves a source andtarget concept,
 and a comparison is made linking some features
 of the two ( Gentner ,1983 ). Following Liu
et al. (2022 ), we refer to the source as the  subject 
and target as  object  .4
We expect objects referenced to be quite differently
 cross-culturally. We confirm this by translating
 sentences from our dataset into English, then
parsing to find objects. The number of unique concepts
 per language, including examples, is listed in
Appendix C . This may overestimate the number of
unique concepts, as some concepts may be closely
related (e.g.,  seasonal rain  vs.  rainy season ).
Despite this, we are able to identify many culturally
 specific concepts in these sentences, such as
specific foods ( hi  samosa, hi  sweet gulkand,
id  durian, id  rambutan), religious figures ( kn 
buddha s smile, sw  king soloman), or references
to popular culture ( id  shinchan, yo  aníkúlápó
movie, en  washington post reporter).
We observe that, excluding pronouns, only 6 objects
 are present in all languages. These are { sky ,
 ant ,  ocean ,  fire ,  sun ,  day }. Of course,
variations of all these concepts and other generic
concepts may exist, since we only deduplicated objects
 up to lemmatization, but this small set may indicate
 that languages tend to vary widely in figurative
 expressions. Appendix D indicates the Jaccard
similarity between objects in each language, which
is an intuitive measure of set similarity. The equation
 is also given below for sets of objects from
language A ( 𝐿𝐴) and langugage B ( 𝐿𝐵).
The most similar language based on concepts
present is highlighted in Table 4 . Languages from
the same region tend to group together. The set
of concepts in English is actually most similar to
Swahili.5Upon inspection, there were many general
 terms related to nature, as well as many references
 to Christianity in the Swahili data, which
may explain the similarity to English.6
4This terminology may be confusable with subject and object
in linguistics, but was used because the source and target tend
to appear in these linguistic positions in a sentence.
5There are no particularly closely related languages to English

4.2 Commonsense Categories
We follow the commonsense categories defined in
Liu et al. (2022 ) to categorize knowledge needed to
understand each sentence  physical object knowledge
 (obj), knowledge about visual scenes (vis),
social knowledge about how humans generally behave
 (soc), or more specific cultural knowledge
(cul). The same sentence can require multiple
types of knowledge. Table 6 shows the prevalence
of each type of commonsense knowledge as documented
 by annotators. Social and object knowledge
 are the most dominant types required, with
Yoruba having an especially high prevalence of social
 examples. Not many examples were marked
as cultural. This may be due to differences in what
annotators viewed as cultural knowledge  some
knowledge may be considered to fall under the
object or social category by annotators, but these
same examples may seem culturally specific to
people residing in the United States because the
objects referenced are not necessarily relevant to
English speakers in the US.

4.3 Cross-lingual concept distribution
To better understand the linguistic and cultural distribution
 of examples, we extract sentence-level
representations from two models  i)XLM-Rlarge
(Conneau et al. ,2019 ), our best performing baseline
 model  and ii)LaBSE ( Feng et al. ,2020 ), a
language-agnostic sentence embedding model, optimized
 for cross-lingual retrieval. We observed
that XLM-R clusters by language, whereas LaBSE
clusters sentences from multiple languages together,
 based on conceptual similarity (as shown
in Figure 2). Since LaBSE is optimized for crosslingual
 sentence similarity, we chose the latter to
conduct further analysis.
First, we probe different edges of the cluster and
observe concepts along each edge, as visualized
in Figure 1. For each concept, we observe sentences
 from various languages clustering together.
Further, these sentences portray cultural traits pertaining
 to each language. For example, rice is
commonly mentioned in languages from Indonesia,
 given that it is a staple food product there.8
Other examples include sentences in Hindi such
asThis house is as old as a diamond (diamonds
have a significant historical background in India)
orYour house is worth lakhs (lakh is an Indian English
To qualitatively study cultural references, we
further analyse metaphors belonging to universal
concepts such as food,weather/season , and friendship,
 searching for sentences containing these keywords.10We
 obtain 230 sentences containing food,
111 sentences containing weather/season and 307
sentences containing friend . A few examples are
as shown in Table 7. We observe multiple regional
and cultural references, which may not be under8https //www.indonesia-investments.com/business/

standable by non-native speakers. For example,
annotators make references to the weather/season
with Peacock andfrying fish on asphalt which are
innate comparisons in su. With reference to food,
Indian food commonly uses Neem andTamarind
as referenced by metaphors in knand hi.Neem
is a bitter medicinal herb and Tamarind is used to
add sourness to food. Finally, we see references to
mythological and fictional characters across friendship
 metaphors, where annotators draw from their
attributes to describe friendships.5 Evaluation and Results
5.1.1 Zero-shot evaluation
Here, we simply fine-tune the Multilingual Pretrained
 Language Models (MPLMs) on the English
labelled data and evaluate on all target languages.
This was performed in the standard format of inputting
 each example as [CLS] [sentence] [SEP]
[meaning1] [SEP] [meaning2] and using a linear
layer on the [CLS] token to classify the answer.
5.1.2 Zero-shot transfer results
We present zero-shot evaluation results in Table 8 ,
noting that there can be two contributors to the gap
in performance in these seven languages as compared
 to English. First, since our fine-tuning language
 is English, there can be a drop in performance
 simply due to cross-lingual transfer. Second,
 there is a concept shift in these metaphors, as
evidenced by our analysis in Section 4. To discern
the contribution of both, we machine-translate the
target test sets to en(we refer to this as translatetest).
 The difference between translate-test and
zero-shot , can be thought of as the cross-lingual
transfer gap, while the rest of the difference between
 translate-test and entest performance can
be attributed to the concept shift. Due to possible
MT errors, the results here represent upper bounds
for concept shift and cross-lingual shift, which isReferences to

further discussed in Section 6.1 .
The concept shift gap is generally greater
than the cross-lingual gap. As reported in Table8,
 the concept shift gap is greater than the
cross-lingual transfer gap for all languages except
Swahili, across all models. This result for swcorroborates
 our findings in Section 4, where we observe
 that enshares the greatest proportion of object
 concepts with sw. Given Swahili s extremely
low-representation in MPLMs (Table 5), and its
high concept overlap with English, we cover most
of the gap by simply translating swto en. For
Indonesian ( id), we observe that zero-shot performance
 itself is close to enperformance (83.6%) for
XLM-R, since idis well-represented in this model
(Table 5). Hence, translating to endoes not help,
and the model needs to be competent in better understanding
 the cultural references specific to id.
In mBERT however, idis poorly represented, and
translating to endoes help improve performance.
Performance increases as model and training
 data size increase, but moreso for higher
resource languages. The smallest model examined,
 mBERT, has relatively poor performance for
all languages, as all languages have   60% accuracy.
 Hindi and Indonesian, the two highestresource
 languages in our dataset, show a high gain
in performance when using a larger model, increasing
 to 67.58% and 78.09% accuracy respectively.
This is especially true for Indonesian, which has a
relatively high amount of training data as shown in
Table 5 . However, lower resource languages tend
to show a more modest gain in performance.5.2 Few-shot
5.2.1 Few-shot evaluation
While it is common to fine-tune MPLMs on English,
 given its widespread use and availability,
several past works have shown how this is suboptimal
 ( Lin et al. ,2019  Debnath et al. ,2021 )
and choosing optimal transfer languages is an
important research question in itself ( Dhamecha
et al. ,2021 ). While the design of an ideal allocation
 of annotation resources is still unknown,
Lauscher et al. (2020 ) demonstrate the effectiveness
 of investing in few-shot (5-10) in-language
task-specific examples, which provides vast improvements
 over the zero-shot setup.
We include between 2-50 labelled pairs of sentences
 from each target language, in addition to
the English labelled data, for fine-tuning the model.
Training details for all models can be found in Appendix
5.2.2 Few-shot results
Figure 3 presents the effects of few-shot transfer
for each language. Generally, the performance
gain is modest. This aligns with results from
Lauscher et al. (2020 ), who found that performance
 gains were quite small on XNLI. As our
task is also an NLI task, we may expect similar
 improvements. However, we find collecting
some cultural examples could disproportionately
help low-resource languages.
Augmenting with few examples usually does
not help much We observed that with a few exceptions,
 the increase in accuracy on the test set gained
was small (   1% ). This is likely because of the diversity
 of facts needed in order to improve performance.
 As noted in Section 4.1 andTable 1 , this
dataset contains many unique cultural references
that do not repeat, limiting the utility of seeing a
Lower-resource languages benefit more
greatly from augmentation However, there are a
few exceptions to this trend. In particular, adding
50 paired Kannada examples to XLM-Rlarge
improved performance by 3.83% . Swahili also
improves by 1.10% with 50 additional examples
for XLM-Rbase, and Sundanese improves by
2.33% with 50 examples for mBERTbase.

The performance of GPT-3 is not very good

note that it has a reasonable zero-shot performance

As noted in Section 5.1 , there are two major factors
 that can cause difficulty in cross-lingual trans-fer  language shift and concept shift. We try to approximate
 these effects by translating the test set in
each language to English. However, this is done
with machine translation, so there may be errors.
Despite this, translation can still benefit the model
if the original language was low-resource. We can
divide the model performance into four cases as

yoFigure 3  Effect of adding up to 50 examples in the target language to the English training data. This strategy is
most beneficial for XLM-Rlargewith more than 10 examples in the target language. Exact results can be found in
cally challenging examples (19%) which are originally
 answered incorrectly, but switch to being
answered correctly after being translated to English.11There
 are difficult-to-translate or incorrectly
 translated examples (15%). It s likely that
these errors can be completely eliminated with a
careful enough translation. Lastly, there are hard
examples (12%) which are answered incorrectly
before and after being translated. These contain
many inherently difficult examples, and examples
with specific cultural terms. Examples of each
type can be found in Appendix G .
6.2 Cultural Examples
We examine the accuracy of XLM-Rlarge on the
commonsense categories in Section 4.2 . Overall,
there is a small difference in accuracy between cultural
 examples and the overall accuracy, with overall
 accuracy at 63.99% and accuracy on cultural
examples at 61.68%. Accuracy for all languages
can be found in Appendix H . This is a preliminary
 analysis, but may indicate that references to
explicit named entities may not be the only issue
for the model with regard to culture.
7.1 Figurative Language
English-centric   Most previous inference tasks
on figurative language have been in English
(Chakrabarty et al. ,2022  Liu et al. ,2022  
Pedinotti et al. ,2021a ). Further, research on figurative
 language in English centers around training
models to detect the presence of metaphors in
text ( Leong et al. ,2020  Stowe and Palmer ,2018  
11Linguistically challenging here means that the language is
more challenging for an LM to perform well in, not that the
linguistic structure is very difficult.Tsvetkov et al. ,2014 ). This is done using datasets
primarily consisting of idioms and conventionalized
 metaphors. However, recognizing common
metaphorical phrases may not truly test a model s
ability to interpret figurative language. There
is limited research on understanding metaphors,
which mostly looks at linking metaphorical
phrases to their literal meanings through paraphrase
 detection ( Bizzoni and Lappin ,2018 ) or
generation ( Shutova ,2010  Mao et al. ,2018 ).
Some studies investigate LMs  ability to understand
 metaphors, but they do not consider the fact
that metaphors have different meanings based on
context ( Pedinotti et al. ,2021b  Aghazadeh et al. ,
2022 ). Most recently, Liu et al. (2022 ) released
a dataset which requires a model to infer the
correct meaning of metaphor, rather than simply
identifying or paraphrasing it, hence calling to test
deeper semantic understanding.
Extension to Multilingual   Research in corpus
linguistics ( Díaz-Vera and Caballero ,2013  Kövecses,2004
  Charteris-Black and Ennis ,2001 ) suggests
 that there significant variation in metaphorical
 language between cultures. There has been
some work in detecting metaphors in multilingual
text ( Tsvetkov et al. ,2013  Shutova et al. ,2017 ).
These works have focused on three relatively highresource
 languages  English, Russian and Spanish.
 Both focused on cross-lingual techniques to
identify metaphors from newspapers and dictionaries.
 Hence, there hasn t been any large-scale multilingual
 dataset of figurative language constructed,
which would allow one to study cultural variations
across metaphors. We fill this gap with the release
of our dataset.8 Conclusion
Despite being relatively widespread, figurative language
 is relatively under-studied in NLP. This is especially
 true for non-English languages. To enable
progress on figurative language processing, we create
 MABL, a figurative inference dataset across
seven languages. We find considerable variation
in figurative language use across languages, particularly
 in the unique objects that people invoke
in their comparisons, spanning differences in food,
mythology and religion, and famous figures or
events. This variation is likely due to differences
in cultural common-ground between the countries
in which these languages are spoken. We find
that multilingual models have considerable room
for improvement on this task, and cross-cultural
shift may play a significant role in the performance
degradation from English. We encourage the NLP
community to further examine the role that culture
 plays in language, and note that figurative language
 can be used as a testbed to examine crosslinguistic
 and cross-cultural variations.
First, despite our pursuit of attempting to understand
 figurative language use across cultures, we
have barely scratched the surface in terms of diverse
 representation. Due to limited scope, budget,
 and resources, we collect data from 2-3 annotators
 per language, for seven languages. Further,
culture can vary greatly within a language ( Hershcovich
 et al. ,2022 ). Therefore, until we can represent
 all of the worlds  people and their languages,
there will always be room for improvement.
We also acknowledge that the syntax captured in
the dataset may not be the most diverse, as many
examples follow the template   X  is like  Y  .
However, we create these simpler examples as a
first step, since extension to more complex and naturalistic
 language can be included in future work.
Second, to analyse concept shift, we machine
translate test sets into English. However, these
translations can be erroneous to varying degrees,
which may have resulted in an over-estimation of
error attribution to concept shift. This could not
be avoided however, due to limited resources of
obtaining human translations.
Third, English may not be the best language to
transfer from in zero-shot evaluation of multilingual
 models. While we were constrained by training
 data availability, past works have shown thatmachine-translating train sets can help, an avenue
we haven t explored here. Even though we experiment
 with few-shot evaluation, there may exist
an optimal combination of source languages which
best transfer to our target languages.
Fourth, the English authors recognized culturespecific
 terms that were not marked as cultural
by annotators in the commonsense categorization
across all languages. This may be because annotators,
 being mostly familiar with their own cultures,
 attributed culturally specific facts and terms
as being common sense. Likewise, the Englishspeaking
 participants may have viewed a separate
set of facts as common sense which would not be
agreed upon by people from a different culture. It
is thus difficult to disentangle common sense and
culture in many cases.

B Instructions for Annotators
InLiu et al. (2022 ), workers are prompted with
random words taken from English metaphorical
frames in Lakoff and Johnson (1981 ). However,
as these metaphorical frames are not readily available
 in other languages, and we did not want to
bias workers toward concepts that are only relevant
 in English, we chose to omit this prompt
and have workers generate sentences freely, while
encouraging them to emphasize aspects of their
culture. Annotators were paid according to their
proposed hourly range ($25/hour on average, all
above $15/hr). Validators were paid $15/hr. This
study was approved by our IRB. No identifying information
Note that this is the English version of the instructions,
 as instructions were machine-translated
to each target language and corrected by native
Your task is to generate pairs of sentences with opposite
 or very different meanings, both of which
contain metaphors. You can feel free to incorporate
 creativity into the metaphors, but also make
sure that they re something that could be understood
 by the speakers of the language that you are
generating metaphors for, e.g.,  this is as classic
as pancakes for breakfast  to mean  this is classic 
 wouldn t make sense for a culture in which
pancakes aren t traditionally eaten for breakfast.
You can do this by thinking of a metaphor that
conveys a certain meaning, and replacing the
metaphorical phrase with another metaphorical
phrase of the same type (for instance, noun
phrases, verb phrases or adjective phrases) that
conveys the opposite meaning.
Here are some examples of metaphors to give you
an idea of what we re looking for  Please write
both the metaphor and its meaning for each sentence.

A hyperparameter grid search was conducted over

10 4, 2   10 5, 5   10 5, 2   10 6, 5   10 6}, and
batch size   {32, 64} .
XLM-Rlarge was trained for 20 epochs with a
learning rate of 5   10 6and a batch size of
32. XLM-Rlargewas trained for 30 epochs with a
learning rate of 2   10 5 and a batch size of 64.
mBERTbasewas trained for 30 epochs with a learning
 rate of 5   10 5and a batch size of 64. An
A6000 GPU was used for each model. Each training
 run takes on the order of a few minutes.
Most seeds lead to a near-random performance
on the English dev set, while a small minority of
seeds lead to non-random performance. We took
the top 5 seeds from 1-100 found in terms of English
 dev set performance in order to avoid including
 results from degenerate seeds.
We did not experiment with trying to optimize
the hyperparameters for the experiments in Section
 5.2.2 but rather used the same ones found previously.
 This may account for some settings leading
 to lower performance.
