Abstract
Human values are crucial to human decision-making. Value
pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held
in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a
friend to protect their feelings , how does one balance honesty
with friendship  ). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to averages
 by default, washing out these potentially irreducible
value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value
pluralism , the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to
which AI systems can model pluralistic human values ,rights ,
andduties as well as their interaction.
We introduce V ALUE PRISM , a large-scale dataset of 218k
values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written situations.
 V ALUE PRISM  s contextualized values are generated
by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91%
of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators
across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to
understand whose values are represented.
With V ALUE PRISM , we build V ALUE KALEIDOSCOPE (or
KALEIDO ), an open, light-weight, and structured languagebased
 multi-task model that generates ,explains , and assesses
therelevance andvalence (i.e., support or oppose) of human
values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans
prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher
GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader coverage.
 In addition, we demonstrate that K ALEIDO can help
explain variability in human decision-making by outputting
contrasting values. Finally, we show that K ALEIDO  s representations
 can transfer to other philosophical frameworks and
datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and
interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our
work will serve as a step to making more explicit the implicit
 values behind human decision-making and to steering
AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance
with them.
1 Introduction
When people confront difficult decisions (whether or not to
break a promise, what degree program to enroll in, how to
spend a Sunday afternoon), their options reflect their values
 (friendship, knowledge, freedom, saving money, spending
 time in nature). Two people in the same situation may
make opposing decisions if they value different things or the
same things but to varying extents (Figure 1). The notion that

 everyday situations to varying degrees. K ALEIDO is
designed to generate, explain, and assess how the pluralistic
 human values, rights, and duties may shape human judgments.

different human values can lead to distinct although potentially
 equally valid  decisions is called value pluralism
(P aez et al. 2020  Komppula et al. 2018 2013 1992 2021  Liscio et al. 2023).
Various fields have focused on this concept. Philosophers
distinguish value pluralism (different views cannot be reduced
 into an ultimate  supervalue  (Williams 1985 1987 1993 1990 1997 2004)) from monism (there exists a single core value (Kant
1785/2002 2022)). Sociologists recognize cultural,
social, and ideological differences that drive societal clashes,
movements, and changes (Archive 2011). Psychologists empirically
 confirm that ethical experiences involve weighing
pluralistic values (Gill and Nichols 2008) and the dissonance
 that arises from misaligned values and beliefs (Festinger
 1962).arXiv 2309.00779 1  [cs.CL]  2 2023 1 2 Filter by  Relevance

Meanwhile, in AI, there is a growing interest in developing
 human-centered AI that emphasizes participation from
stakeholders. This which necessitates the inclusion and exploration
 of pluralistic voices and values (Tasioulas 2022 
Gordon et al. 2022). Yet, contemporary supervised AI systems
 primarily wash out variation by aggregating opinions
or preferences with majority votes (Plank 2022  Talat et al.
2022  Casper et al. 2023). As real-world AI applications are
used to assist increasing and more diverse audiences, it is
crucial to investigate and better model the the values that are
accessible and used by current AI systems.
In this work, we make the first large-scale attempt at
investigating large language models  (LLMs) potential to
model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties . Our effort
 is twofold  (1) we introduce V ALUE PRISM , a large-scale
dataset of pluralistic human values  (2) we build V ALUE
KALEIDOSCOPE (KALEIDO ), an open and flexible valuepluralistic
 model.
The dataset  V ALUE PRISM contains 218k contextualized
 values, rights, and duties connected to 31k real-life situations,
 distilled from GPT-41. While GPT-4 and its like have
been shown to match human crowdworker annotation performance
 in some domains (Gilardi, Alizadeh, and Kubli
2023  Ziems et al. 2023  Rytting et al. 2023), we exercise
caution and do not assume that GPT-4 s outputs are necessarily
 correct or representative. To this end, we conduct
large-scale human studies and find that humans rate the outputs
 as high-quality 91% of the time and have difficulty
coming up with considerations that the model has missed,
detecting missing values  1% of the time. We also conduct a
comprehensive study with diverse annotators across diverse
social and demographic groups to evaluate whose voices are
represented in the values GPT-4 produces. Additionally, a
growing line of work demonstrates that the large-scale with
which data can be produced with LLMs can make up for the
1Datasheet for Datasets (Gebru et al. 2018) documentation in
Appendix N)potential noise that is introduced, leading to student models
 which often surpass the teacher (West et al. 2022b  Kim
et al. 2023  Jung et al. 2023).
The model  V ALUE KALEIDOSCOPE (KALEIDO )is a
value-pluralistic model that, based on V ALUE PRISM ,generates
 ,explains , and assesses the relevance and valence
(i.e., support or oppose) of contextualized pluralistic human
values, rights, and duties. On top of the model, we build a
flexible system K ALEIDOSYSleveraging K ALEIDO  s generation
 and relevance prediction modes to create a diverse,
high quality set of relevant values for a situation (See Fig. 2).
In human studies, people rate our system s outputs as more
correct and complete than the teacher s (GPT-4). Annotators
also find that our largest model matches the teacher s performance
 at rationalizing and predicting valence. Additionally,
 we show that K ALEIDO can help explain ambiguity and
variability underlying human decision-making in nuanced
situations by generating contrasting values. We also demonstrate
 that K ALEIDO can be adapted to various philosophical
frameworks without explicit training.
Overall, our work represents the first comprehensive attempt
 to articulate decision-making into fine-grained, pluralistic
 components of human values employing large language
 models. The resulting dataset and model serve as a
large-scale resource explicitly supporting value pluralism,
shedding light on future AI development that accommodates
a rich and inclusive tapestry of value alternatives.2 2 Value-pluralistic Framework  Values,
Rights and Duties
2.1 Why are pluralistic human values critical 
Machine learning methods are generally designed to model
averages, but can miss nuance and in-group variation unless
 explicitly accounted for (Gordon et al. 2022). To go
beyond this, we take inspiration from philosophical value
2https //github.com/tsor13/kaleido.pluralism, the stance that there are many different normative
values (Mason 2006), as opposed to one super-value that all
other values can be reduced to. This is distinct both from
political pluralism, which posits that diversity is beneficial
to democratic society and supports the distribution of power
among diverse groups (Britannica Editors 2002)  and from
relativism, which holds that no moral system is more correct
than another (Gowans 2021).
Without taking a hard stance on these positions, we seek
to better model humans  plural values to make explicit the
implicit values in human decision-making. Our hope is that,
if pluralistic values can be adequately (though imperfectly)
modeled, we can take a step towards ensuring that automated
decision-makers act in accordance with them.
2.2 Framework Motivation and Definition
In this work, we model human-centered plural values to
make explicit implicit values in human decision-making. We
settle on values (Mason 2006), rights (Prabhakaran et al.
2022 2023), and duties (Alexander and Moore 2021)
as our three core concepts. We propose a commonsense
framework for reasoning about them, and outline them below.

Values  These are the intrinsic goods or ideals that people
pursue or cherish, such as happiness, well-being, justice, or
freedom. Values are the desirable qualities that people may
seek in their lives and in the world. They are often the guiding
 principles for individuals and societies, shaping goals,
motivations, and preferences.
Duties  Duties are the moral obligations or responsibilitiesthat
 individuals owe to others or to society at large. They
are categorical reasons for doing or refraining from doing
something, independent of whether we want to do or refrain
from doing that thing. Duties can be weighty reasons, not
easily overridden by competing concerns, and their violation
may justify blame and self-blame (guilt). Duties can arise
from relationships, social roles, or moral principles, and they
guide our actions and decisions.
Rights  Rights are the entitlements or claims that individuals
 have against others or society, which are usually based
on moral or legal grounds. These can be positive rights (e.g.,
the right to education, healthcare, or free speech) or negative
 rights (e.g., the right to not be harmed, enslaved, or discriminated
 against). Rights serve to protect the fundamental
interests of individuals and establish certain boundaries that
others must respect.
3 K ALEIDO   Value-pluralistic Modeling
We introduce K ALEIDO , a language-based multi-task system
 that generates ,explains , and assesses the relevance and
valence (i.e., support or oppose) of pluralistic human values,
rights, and duties, grounded in real-world contexts.
3.1 Tasks
We develop four tasks for modeling values, rights, and duties,
 all grounded in a given context situation.

are relevant for a situation  Generate a value, right, or duty

Relevance (2-way classification) Is a value relevant for
a situation  Some values are more relevant than others.
Valence (3-way classification) Does the value support or
oppose the action, or might it depend on context  Disentangling
 the valence is critical for understanding how plural
considerations may interact with a decision.
Explanation (open-text) How does the value relate to the

3.2 Dataset  V ALUE PRISM
We leverage the symbolic knowledge distillation (West et al.
2022a) pipeline to distill high-quality knowledge from powerful
 generative models like GPT-4, which have been shown
to compare favorably to human annotations on quality, coverage,
 and diversity (West et al. 2022a  Gilardi, Alizadeh,
and Kubli 2023  Ziems et al. 2023). Importantly, based onour preliminary exploration, GPT-4 excels at enumerating
awide range of value alternatives compared to average human
 annotations. We verify the dataset s quality with human
 annotators and show that 91% of the distilled data is
deemed high quality, surpassing typical quality of human
generated data (West et al. 2022a  Hwang et al. 2021  Zhou
et al. 2023). Details on dataset statistics and splits are provided
 in App. F.1 and examples from V ALUE PRISM can be
found in App. A.
Situations Starting from 1.3M human-written base situations3,
 we obtain a set of 31K clean situations for deriving
plural considerations by carefully filtering out ill-formatted,
irrelevant, and low-quality situations using few-shot Flan-T5
(Chung et al. 2022). To balance out an outsize proportion of
toxic, NSFW, or sexually explicit content, we down-sample
these situations to 5% of all data, leading to an increase in
the overall diversity of the dataset, as measured by the normalized
 count of unique n-grams (dist-2  .23  .36, dist-3 
.54 .67, details in App. F.1).
Values, Rights, and Duties Generation For each of the
31K situations, we prompt GPT-4 to generate relevant values,
 rights, and duties, with open-text rationales. GPT-4
also attributes whether the corresponding value, right, or
duty supports (justifies), opposes (condemns), or depends on
the context or interpretation. Details of data generation and
prompting are in Appendix F.1 and M. The resulting dataset
is rated as high-quality (91%) by human evaluation ( 4.1).
Multi-task Setup We convert V ALUE PRISM into a
sequence-to-sequence format for multi-task training. The
relevance task data is sampled contrastively, where positive
examples are from GPT-4 and negative examples are drawn
from values mapped to other situations. We split the data (by
actions) into 80% train/10% validation/10% test.
3.3 Model Training
We use Flan-T5 3B (Chung et al. 2022) as the base model for
KALEIDO . After fitting hyperparameters with a grid search,
we train on a mixture of all four tasks with Huggingface s
Trainer (Wolf et al. 2020) for 4 epochs with early stopping.
Training takes 19 100 GPUs. Training details
are in App. G.
3.4 A System of Diverse Values  K ALEIDOSYS
We use K ALEIDO to generate a diverse set of values, rights,
and duties by overgenerating (top 100 beams) and removing
 low-quality and repetitive outputs via the relevance score
and text similarity respectively. We use Rouge-score (Lin
2004) for n-gram similarity and a Transformers (Wolf et al.
2020) mpnet model for sentence embeddings. See Fig. 2
for an illustration of the system and Appendix H/Algorithm
1 for more details. We tune the system parameters (relevance
score threshold, similarity thresholds) using Gibbs sampling
(Casella and George 1992) to maximize RougeL-Sum F1
score on the validation set. Ablation experiments in  5.1 3Sourced from user queries submitted to the Delphi demo.
4https //huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-basev provide
 insights on each system component, and example
model outputs can be found in Table 1 and App. B.
4 4.1 V ALUE PRISM is high-quality
We conduct human validation of V ALUE PRISM to assess the
its quality on the Mechanical Turk platform5. Given the generated
 situation and values, rights, and duties and their explanations,
 we ask the annotators to assess the relevance and
quality of the generations. The results show that annotators
find the great majority of the data as high quality. 91% of the
values/rights/duties was marked as good by all three annotators
 and 87% of the valences were marked as correct by all
three annotators.
In an attempt to find any values that may have been
missed, we also prompt crowdworkers to fill in any missing
 values, rights, or duties. Crowdworkers didn t seem to
find it easy to come up with missing values as we get suggestions
 0.35% of the time. Full annotation details for this
and other studies are in App. I.
4.2 Evaluation by diverse annotators
Prior research has reported unjust bias in LLMs against
marginalized groups (Sap et al. 2019  Feng et al. 2023). We
evaluate V ALUE PRISM by recruiting a diverse population of
613 annotators through CloudResearch (Litman, Robinson,
and Abberbock 2017) targeting those marginalized groups to
the extent possible7. We collect 31 683
values, rights, and duties in the context of 100 situations,
along with demographic information across eight categories.
The annotators mark 1) if they agree with each value, right,
or duty listed for a given situation and 2) if they spot any
missing perspective. We do not find notable statistical significance,
 and do not reject the null hypothesis that there is
no difference between groups. Additional group statistics,
p-values, and qualitative analyses are in App. E.
4.3 Diversity of V ALUE PRISM
We analyze the diversity of the situations, and values, rights,
and duties from three perspectives  lexical diversity that calculates
 uniqueness n-grams, topical diversity that assesses
semantic diversity via topic analysis8, and clustering . Both
5For this and other human studies, we have acquired the opinion
 of our institutions s Internal Review Board. The opinion finds
our project exempt from a full review process in accordance to the
United States Federal regulation 45 46, and we have acquired
a letter of exception. We hash crowdworker IDs so annotations cannot
 be back-traced to individual workers.

7We chose CloudResearch specifically because of its ability to
target by demographic. One weakness of this study, however, is
that all of our respondents are U.S.-based (where CloudResearch
operates). Prior work has shown that value representation can vary
across nationality as well (Santy et al. 2023), and we hope to extend
this study internationally in the future.

5 5.1 Our System Against the Teacher
Generating correct and complete sets of values Central
to our research is the capability to model pluralistic values,
rights, and duties. Ideally, these values should be correct,
have high coverage, and be aligned with human preferences.
We recruit crowdworkers to evaluate K ALEIDOSYSdirectly
against GPT-4 across these three dimensions.
We run several variations of K ALEIDOSYS  all model sizes
(60 11B)  3B version without the relevance and text similarity
 components ( -relevance ,-text similarity )  and tweaked
3B system parameters to output more or fewer values, rights,
and duties9(verbose ,concise ). To understand the benefit of
our system, we also train a baseline seq seq 3B model on the
same data that tries to predict a batch of values, rights, and
duties in one generation pass. We test each version against
GPT-4 200 2 annotators each.
From Table 2, we make several observations. The three
largest versions of our system outperform GPT-4 on all evaluated
 dimensions, with the largest variant (11B) being the
most favored overall. Moreover, the models generating a
higher number of values (  11) are preferred by humans
9To better understand how changing the parameters can affect
the output/precision/recall, see Figure 4Model Explanation Valence Rel. corr.

for coverage and accuracy.10Our system also shows an advantage
 over the direct output seq seq model, despite being
trained on the same data. Furthermore, removing relevance
leads to a drop in the overall preference, which is not observed
 in verbose with the same number of outputs. This
suggests relevance is indeed a contributing factor to the generation
 quality. Finally, humans show lower preference for
outputs without deduplication with text similarity.
Explanation and Valence Label Quality We also evaluated
 the explanation generation and valence labeling abilities
 of each model using 700 predefined values, rights,
and duties from the test set of V ALUE PRISM . Crowdworkers
 were tasked with evaluating the quality of explanations,
their effectiveness in linking values to actions, and agreement
 with valence labels. As depicted in Table 3, the 11B
model s performance closely aligns with that of GPT-4. The
11 1% difference
 from GPT-4 and slightly outperformed it in terms of
Explanation quality.
5.2 Relevance Correlates with Human Judgments
We would like K ALEIDO to predict whether a human would
find a value, right, or duty relevant. However, its training
data is synthetic, so the model instead predicts whether a
given value was likely to be generated for a particular situation
 by GPT-4. To test how well this correlates with how
humans judge relevance, we collect 18 700 values/rights/duties for relevance, and correlate the relevance
 score with the percentage of people who marked
the value as relevant (See Table 3). We find correlations of
0.25-0.31 11(all significant at
p   10 10). While we would like to explicitly train models
to predict human relevance scores in future work, we take
this as evidence that our synthetic relevance score correlates
positively with human judgments.
10This is in line with prior work showing that humans prefer
longer outputs with more unique n-grams (Wang et al. 2023b)
11Interestingly, we note that the correlation does not strictly improve
 with model size. While we are unsure of the reason for this,
we note that 11B gives much more confident relevance scores, and
hypothesize that this overconfidence may be miscalibrated to human
 judgments.5.3 Zero-shot performance on ETHICS
While our model is explicitly trained to recognize values,
rights, and duties, we want to understand how much the
learned representations generalize to other frameworks as
well. To do this, we test K ALEIDO on the ETHICS benchmark
 (Hendrycks et al. 2023), which contains crowdsourced
ethical judgments across several different frameworks, fitting
 templates with values, rights, or duties that loosely correspond
 to the frameworks (see Appendix L).

 of each entry is performance on the test/hard test sets
respectively. K ALEIDO is zero-shot, ChatGPT is few-shot.
Results are in Table 4. On all five tasks, our model performs
 well over the random baseline. On all tasks but Commonsense,
 our model matches or exceeds (Justice, Deont.,
Virtue, Util.) ChatGPT s performance, while only having 3B
parameters. Despite having only been trained to predict values,
 rights, and duties, our model meaningfully generalizes
to other frameworks.
5.4 Interpretable Decision System and Zero-Shot
on C OMMONSENSE NORM BANK
While the focus of the system is on modeling diverse values
and not on making judgments, it can be easily extended to
output the valence of an action V(a) 
V(a)  X
v V RDR(v a) V(v a)
where v V RD are the generated values, rights, and duties
from K ALEIDOSYS,R(v a)is the relevance of vgiven the
action, and V(v a)is the valence of vgiven the action. We
will denote this decision system K ALEIDODEC.
This system has the advantage of being interpretable, enabling
 direct inspection of how values linearly contribute to
the outcome. It is also steerable, as users can easily assign a
weight of zero to values they do not wish to take into consideration.

Zero-shot C OMMONSENSE NORM BANK performance
We evaluate this system in a zero-shot manner on the four
subportions of moral acceptability segment of C OMMON SENSE
 NORM BANK (Jiang et al. 2022) (See Table 5). In all
cases, the system performs at least as well as the majority
class baseline, and much (  25%) better on ETHICS and
Moral Stories12.

We observe that the classes are not well calibrated to the

regression. For SBIC and SocialChem it improves accuracy
by about 5% and 15% respectively, suggesting that while the
model is not initially well-calibrated to the datasets, relevant
information can be linearly extracted. While K ALEIDODEC
achieves non-trivial zero-shot performance, it unsurprisingly
performs worse than supervised baselines such as Delphi.

 on which value is prioritized. Because of this, when
KALEIDODECoutput has high entropy, we hypothesize that
this may indicate higher variability in the distribution of decisions.
 To test this, we explore two datasets with variability
indicators. M ORAL CHOICE (Scherrer et al. 2023) contains
687 low-ambiguity and 680 high-ambiguity moral scenarios.
 S OCIAL CHEM (Forbes et al. 2021) is a corpus of social0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 0.20.40.6 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 0204060
# of Values, Rights, Duties
Same as GPT-4 (7.0)Figure 4  By sweeping K ALEIDOSYS s parameters, we are
able to trade precision (w.r.t. to GPT-4) with recall, and output
 many more (or fewer) values, rights, and duties.
Figure 5  K ALEIDO is sensitive to subtle changes in inputs,
changing relevance and valence scores accordingly.
norms where, among other things, crowdworkers annotated
for  What portion of people probably agree that [action] is
[good / bad]  . We take those marked as  99% to have
low controversialness, and those marked as  50% as having
high controversialness. We run the corresponding scenarios
through K ALEIDODECand measure the entropy (Figure 3).
We find that the entropy is predictive of these classes. In line
with our hypothesis, the higher the entropy, the more likely
a situation is to be ambiguous or controversial, even though
the model was not trained to predict these things explicitly.
6 Discussion
Strengths Over Teacher Model Although our model performs
 strongly against the teacher in value generation, it also
boasts several other advantages. It is controllable, allowing
users to generate either more or fewer values than GPT-4
by trading precision for recall (see Figure 4). Additionally,
while GPT-4 provides only textual labels for valence, our
model generates scalar valence and relevance scores. Lastly,
our model, dataset, and code are openly accessible, enabling
scientific review that is crucial for accountability and improvement.

KALEIDO is Sensitive to Situation Variations One of
the strengths of our approach is that the signal can be contextualized
 and dependent on the relevant values. For example,
 consider three variations of a situation   Leticia kisses
Marco,   Leticia kisses Marco when he doesn t agree,  and
 Leticia kisses Marco when he is sick  (see Figure 5). In all
three situations, affection and consent are relevant values,as reflected by their relevance scores. However, the valence
changes  consent can either support or oppose the action in
the two underspecified situations, but opposes  when Marco
doesn t agree.  Additionally, the value of health isn t usually
relevant in the typical context of kissing  however,  when
Marco is sick,  health becomes relevant and opposes the action.
 This demonstrates the ability of K ALEIDO to adjust to
subtle input changes13.
False Balance and Extreme Inputs One potential danger
 when generating diverse values is coming up with a contrived
 reason why something might be good or bad, even if
no reasonable person may hold such a value in such a situation
 (This is similar to false balance, or bothesidesism,
in news reporting (Imundo and Rapp 2021 2004)). To probe at this, we hand-write 20 situations
 (10 bad/10 good, in Appendix J) for which we cannot
come up with reasonable values, rights, or duties that would
support or oppose them respectively. We run them through
KALEIDOSYSafter development and find no generated supporting
 values/rights/duties for the extreme bad actions nor
any opposing for the good actions. We take this as limited
evidence that our system can avoid false balance.
Universal Declaration of Human Rights Inspired by
(Prabhakaran et al. 2022), we think that an ideal dataset containing
 human rights would contain all rights listed in the
United Nation s Universal Declaration of Human Rights14
(UDHR). We manually extract all human rights we could
find from the UDHR (41), and find the 20 closest rights
in the dataset by entailment score with WANLI (Liu et al.
2022a). We then go through all 41 sets manually and label
each for whether or the right is included. We are able to find
matches in V ALUE PRISM for 97.5% of the UDHR s human
rights, demonstrating that the dataset has broad coverage of
the UDHR.15.
7 Related Work
Value Representations of Language Models Scholars
from diverse disciplines have engaged in extensive discussions
 regarding the incorporation of human ethics and values
 into LLMs (Wallach and Allen 2008  Jiang et al. 2022 
Hendrycks et al. 2023), understanding cultural influences
(Santy et al. 2023), examining opinion alignment (Santurkar
et al. 2023), and using LLMs as proxies for studying specific
 human sub-populations in social science research (Argyle
 et al. 2023). (Jiang et al. 2022) introduced Delphi, a
framework trained to reason about ethical perspectives, and
showed the ethical limitations of out-of-the-box LLMs. Another
 noteworthy dimension is the multicultural nature of
LLMs. (Santy et al. 2023) explored the cultural disparities
manifest in LMs and their implication for diverse societies.
(Tasioulas 2022) criticized the prevailing preference-based
utilitarian approach (i.e., which act is likely to yield the optimal
 fulfillment of human preferences) in AI ethics, pointing

 example.

ethics that accounts for the nuanced human views on ethics.
Moreover, Santurkar et al. (2023)  Durmus et al. (2023) introduced
 novel opinion datasets, quantitatively analyzed the
opinions conveyed by LMs, and unveiled substantial misalignments
 between the viewpoints of current LMs and specific
 demographic groups within the United States.
Alignment of Large Language Models Several computational
 approaches have been proposed to address the challenge
 of aligning LLMs with desired values and objectives.
Reinforcement learning (RL) has historically been used in
multiple NLP tasks to ensure that the generated text is optimized
 for an arbitrary non-differentiable reward (Johnson
et al. 2017  Nguyen, Daum  e III, and Boyd-Graber 2017  Ramamurthy
 et al. 2022  Pyatkin et al. 2023). Lu et al. (2022)
optimized a reward function that quantifies an undesired
property, while not straying too far from the original model
via a KL-divergence penalty. (Bai et al. 2022) explored RL
techniques for training LLMs to adhere to legal and ethical
guidelines encoded in a constitution, naming it  Constitutional
 AI . Wu et al. (2023) used fine-grained human feedback
 as an explicit training signal to train and learn from
reward functions in a RLHF fashion. Additionally, Lu et al.
(2023) proposed an inference-time algorithm to efficiently
tailor LLMs without no fine-tuning, addressing tasks like ensuring
 safety and fidelity in dialogue models.
Automatic Dataset Curation Previous research in automatic
 data generation has focused on creating datasets for
various tasks, such as commonsense reasoning (West et al.
2022a  Bhagavatula et al. 2023  Wang et al. 2023a  Kim
et al. 2023), dialogues (Kim et al. 2023  Xu et al. 2023 
Chiang et al. 2023), summarization (Sclar et al. 2022  Jung
et al. 2023), and contextual reasoning about offensive statements
 (Zhou et al. 2023) . (West et al. 2022a) introduce the
symbolic knowledge distillation framework, which has been
extended in subsequent studies through iterative distillation
(Sclar et al. 2022  Jung et al. 2023  Bhagavatula et al. 2023).
In addition, (Liu et al. 2022b) propose a human-AI collaboration
 approach to generate high-quality datasets with challenging
 examples.
8 Conclusion
In this work, we contribute V ALUE PRISM and K ALEIDO
in the hopes of leading to better value-pluralistic modeling.
We validate V ALUE PRISM  s quality with two human studies,
 and find that K ALEIDO outperforms the teacher s strong
performance at generating relevant values, rights, and duties
 for a given situation. We also show that K ALEIDO can
help explain variability in human decisions and generalizes
to data and frameworks outside of its training scope.
9 Ethical Considerations and Limitations
Machine-Generated Data. We use GPT-4 s open-text generative
 capabilities to collect V ALUE PRISM , leveraging the
wide variety of knowledge about human values, rights, and
duties latent in LLM s pretraining data. However, we also
recognize that in doing so we run the potential for introducing
 the majority s bias  the generated data may be limited tothe values of certain majority groups. In an effort to assess
the extent of value plurality and represention, we make a deliberate
 effort to conduct the validation of the V ALUE PRISM
by collecting annotations from annotators of various social
and demographic backgrounds as described in  4.2. The human
 annotators find the majority of our data as high-quality
at a high agreement rate. Additionally, less than 1% of the
validated situations were found to be lacking. Nevertheless,
a more extensive study that focuses on the type and nature
of value plurality covered by V ALUE PRISM remains a compelling
 direction for future research.
Intended Use. We make V ALUE PRISM openly available
by individual request with the hope and intention that it furthers
 research in value pluralism in NLP and AI. However,
it is possible that our data can be used in malicious and unintended
 application (e.g., speech policing or promotion of
certain values). We do not endorse its use in such capacity
and emphasize that the use of our dataset and model should
be limited to research purposes only. Additionally, we limit
the data and model available only by individual request to
try to prohibit non-research use cases and ensure fair use.

C Dataset Analysis
C.1 What is contained in our situations 
Situations In this section, we analyze the set of 30k situations
 that we source from the Delphi user demo fromthree different perspectives  lexical diversity ,topical diversity,
 and clustering . For lexical diversity, we calculate the
quantity and percentage of unique situations and n-grams as
illustrated in Table 8. We find that the data we collected contains
 diverse distinct situations with high lexical variations.
Fortopical diversity , we analyze semantic-level diversity
by extracting topics for all the situations with BERTopic19 8. We find that some common topics includes  children ,
 save ,  kill ,  helping ,  stealing , and  family . In general,
 our corpus spans a wide spectrum of topics reflecting
various types of events. For clustering , we first group the
situations using agglomerative clustering and then employ
ChatGPT to generate summaries of the situations within
each cluster. Table 9 10 clusters that contains the
highest number of examples. We discovered that the clusters
 encompass a broad array of themes. Interestingly, some
clusters even contain situations of conflicting values such as
 stealing bread to alleviate starvation. , which further amplifies
 the intrigue and complexity of our corpus.
Values, Right, and Duties We conduct the similar analysis
 for the values, rights, and duties associated with the 30k
situations sourced from the Delphi user demo. For lexical
diversity (Table 8), we observe high lexical variations in
them that indicate the diversity of corpus. Topical diversity
(Fig. 8) shows that V ALUE PRISM covers a broad spectrum
of common, every topics like  respect ,  protect ,  care ,
and  promote . Finally, Table 10 10 clusters
that contains the highest number of examples. We find that
the clusters encompass a wide variety of themes, reflecting
the diversity and the richness of the values, rights, and duties
in our corpus.
C.2 How do the values interact with each other 
For the majority of situations more than one value/right/duty
can be relevant. We therefore examine the co-occurrence
counts of instances among each of the three categories.
Fig. 9 visualizes how a subset of values co-occurrs with each
other  human life as a value often is mentioned alongside
utilitarianism andchild well-being is connected with discipline
 . The former co-occurrence can be explained with some
of the trolley problem situations found in the input data, such
asSacrificing eighty mens  lives to save the former American
 President William Jefferson Clinton s life . The latter cooccurring
 values are mentioned in the context of situations
such as spanking kids . Frequently co-occurring items can either
 be in support of each other, such as financial security vs.
risk-taking , or show two opposing viewpoints, such as deterrence
 andrehabilitation . Similar visualizations for rights
and duties can be found in the Appendix (Fig. 7, Fig. 6).
C.3 Relationship with Machine Judgments
Machine judgments on morality vs. generated values/rights/duties
 To see how values, rights, and duties are
influenced by the all-things-considered judgment of a situation,
 we collect predicted moral judgments from Delphi
(Jiang et al. 2022). Each situation gets labeled to be either
19https //maartengr.github.io/BERTopicbad, ok, or good. Note that these predictions come from a
trained model and can thus be noisy. In Table 11, we see
which supporting and opposing values/rights/duties are most
likely to co-occur with each label. The situation giving a
man a fish , for example, is judged to be good according
to Delphi and two values mentioned for this situation are
compassion andself-reliance .Compassion is a supporting
value that often co-occurrs with situations labeled as good
andself-reliance and opposing value.

What is the effect of dataset mixture on performance 
Our base model was trained with a mixture of all four task.
We find that all tasks except relevance are benefited from a
mixture as opposed to training a separete model for each,
suggesting that the tasks are complementary. As we ablate
each task out of the mixture individually, we see minimal
changes in performance across all tasks, suggesting that no
one task is crucial to the gain in performance seen from mixing.

What is the effect of model size on performance  For
all tasks, larger models perform better. Perplexity improves
steadily with model size, whereas classification accuracies
(Relevance and Valence) see a large boost going from 60 220M parameters. As there are not large performance
gains in going from the 3 11B model ( 1% accuracy
and 0.01-0.15 perplexity), we think that the 3B model has
a good trade-off between performance and computational
cost.Data TypeEntries 2-grams 3-grams

Similarly, we also compare the outputs of different sized systems
 with Rouge-score against the GPT-4 outputs (See Table
13).
D.3 Values manifested in identifying hate speech
We run K ALEIDOSYSon Social Bias Frames (Sap et al.
2020), a dataset containing instances of online speech, some
of which is labeled as hate speech and some of which is
not. We look at the most frequent values generated, and find
that the most common opposing values are Respect (for others),Equality
 ,Tolerance , and Right to Privacy , while the
top supporting values are Freedom of speech (orexpression ),
Humor ,Honesty , and Right to freedom of speech . These values
 represent 17% and 26% of the generated oppose/support
 value counts, respectively. Even though K ALEIDO is
not trained explicitly to recognize hate speech, it is able to
surface values that are violated by hate speech, along with
values that run counter to excessive speech moderation.
E CloudResearch Results
In our study, we collect 31 612 683 values, rights, and duties in the context of 100
situations. The annotators mark 1) each value for whether
or not they agree with it and 2) whether they have an opinion
 or perspective that is missing from the data for a given
situation. Results are found in Tables 18 20.
We find that annotators agree with the values, rights, and
duties 81% of the time on average, and state that they have
a missing perspective 30% of the time. Note that this is less
agreement and more missing perspectives than we saw for
the quality annotation. This is not surprising to us, as some
annotators may consider a value output high-quality and reasonable
 according to someone, even though they may not
agree with it themselves (a much more subjective measure).
Additionally, people were allowed to list missing perspectives
 in a free-form text box. Responses are hand-coded by
the authors as having content or not, and the variable  has a
missing perspective  is binarized. We find that many of the
non-null responses merely state that the person has a missing
perspective, not what it is (e.g.,  Yes ) or do not map cleanly
onto the values, rights, and duties framework (e.g.,  do what
is correct ,  Take care of orphan is not wrong ). This highlights
 a weakness of the framework  not all perspectives fit
neatly into it.
We conduct 2 statistical analyses on the data. First, with
ANOV A testing for each demographic group, we did not find
statistically significant differences in agreement or missing
perspective rates between subgroups (Table 16). We also
compute a regression analysis for ordinal variables and most
common subgroup vs. rest 2-sided t-tests for categorical
groups (Table 17) and did not find significant results except
for 2 groups  male (vs. non-male) folks were more likely and
straight (vs. non-straight) folks were less likely to share a

E.1 Agreement examples
In general, we see that most people agree with most of the
outputs (  80% agreement rate), which suggests that most of
VALUE PRISM represents agreed upon human values, at least
for the majority of cases. However, some claims seemed to
be more or less agreed upon - see Table 14 208 demographics * 2 dependent variables (agree and missing) *
2 kinds of analyses (ANOV A   regression or t-test)
21https //xkcd.com/882/the most and least agreed upon claims, as well as claims with
average agreement.
However, there are a small number of cases for which
there was much higher agreement in one subgroup than another.
 See Table 15 for examples where there is particular
divergence by political orientation.

We note that an outsize proportion of the dataset involves
toxic, NSFW, or sexually explicit content. In the interest of
having a diversity of situations, we label for these attributes1
using Flan-T5 (Chung et al. 2022). We sample 95% of our
situations from those that have less toxic/NSFW/explicit
content, and the other 5% uniformly from the rest of the data
so as to include the entire spectrum of inputs. We find that
this succeeds in increasing the diversity of the dataset, as
measured by unique n-grams divided by the length of the
dataset (dist-2  .23  .36, dist-3  .54  .67).
Symbolic Knowledge Distillation using LLMs After experimentation,
 we find initial success in using GPT-4 (OpenAI
 2023) to generate values. As is often the case, solution
verification is often easier than solution generation, and we
find it to be quite a challenging task to generate a comprehensive
 set of values, rights, and duties that could be considered
 for a situation. While we find that we as authors can
provide more accurate (precise) lists, we anecdotally find
that GPT-4 often does better at breadth (recall). See Appendix
 A for examples. Additionally, because the generation
task requires such cognitive effort, the cost to hire crowdworkers
 to generate a dataset of the size that we desire would
be prohibitive. As such, we follow prior work [CITE, add in
from related work] and decide to use a LLM to create a synthetic
 dataset of values. We verify the quality (Section 4.1)
and representativeness (Section 4.2) of the outputs using human
 annotators.Values, Rights, and Duties Generation Given the set of
31k situations, we prompt GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023) to generate
 relevant values, rights, and duties23, along with an opentext
 explanation. Given the output, the model also predicts
whether the corresponding value, right, or duty supports (or
justifies) the action, opposes (or condemns) the action, or
could either support or oppose depending on the context or
interpretation. The cost to generate the entire dataset was
$1,043.80.
While the data was generated in a batch manner to produce
 all values and related data at once, we exploit the structure
 of the generated data to cast the Generation, Valence,
and Explanation tasks as sequence-to-sequence (seq seq)
tasks. The relevance task data is sampled contrastively,
where positive examples are values generated by GPT-4 for
the situation negative samples are drawn from other generated
 values. We split the data (by actions) into train/validation/test
 splits of 80%/10%/10% respectively (See Table 7).
G Model Training Details
For training, we set our model size at 3 5 encoder-decoder architecture (Raffel et al. 2020),
and test the following hyperparameters  weight initialization
 in {t5-3B, flan-t5-xl }, learning rate in {1e-4, 3e-4, 1 5,
 3e-5 }, and a dataset mixture of either {Generation, Relevance,
 Valence }or{Generation, Relevance, Valence, Explanation}.
 Because the explanation is post-hoc and of lesser
interest to us than the other tasks, we choose the optimal
set up on the validation set of the task mixture without the
explanation task.
We conduct a grid search and settle with learning rate at
3e-5 32 with a mixture of all four tasks.
For further analysis of the relationship of data mixture and
model size with performance, see App. D.1.
We train with Huggingface s Trainer (Wolf et al. 2020) for
4 32, although
we find that the majority of runs start to overfit after about 2
epochs. Training takes 19 100 GPUs.
We fix hyperparameters for the remainder of our experiments
 at the optimal hyperparameters  flan-t5-xl, 3e-5, and
the mixture including explanations (which we find to assist
 generalization on the non-explanation tasks). For further
analysis of the relationship of data mixture and model size
with performance, see Section D.1. We refer to our default
3B trained model as K ALEIDO .

I Annotation Details
For all studies, we carefully monitored the time workers
were spending on our tasks, and ensured minimum average
hourly wages of $15-$25 USD.I.1 Quality Annotation
For this study, 3 crowdowkers for GPT-4 3k situations
 (10% of V ALUE PRISM ). See Figure 10 for the template
 used. For this study, note that we do not ask annotators
to provide their own judgments of the situation, but merely
to assess the relevance of the generations, which we expect
to have much lower variation (e.g., someone may see how a
value could be relevant for someone else while disagreeing
with it themselves).
On an individual annotation level, 97% of the output annotations
 are  good  and 95% of the valence annotations
are  correct.  We find a Fleiss  kappa of .04 for quality and
.12 for the valence labels. While this seems like low agreement,
 this is a known phenomena that happens with highly
skewed data (Randolph 2005). On the other hand, absolute
agreement levels of 91%/87% respectively are quite high.
The total cost of this study was $4,680.00 USD.Situation Claim Description

tasks. Surveys were filled out in Qualtrics after crowdworkers
 were recruited using CloudResearch. The total cost of
the study was $3,562.95 USD.
For this task, we do not report agremeent levels as
we were specifically probing for subjective measurements
(opinions) as opposed to objective ones. For further analysis,
 see App. E.
For the agreement task, the authors manually went
through responses to code them as either having a missing
perspective, or being devoid of content (e.g., , No,Nothing
I can think of ,I agree with it all , etc.). For purposes of the
analysis, this is then binarized. Empty responses are coded
as being devoid of content (no missing perspective).I.3 Value, Right, and Duty Batch Comparison vs.
GPT-4
For this study, a fixed set of 200 test examples was used
for all systems, each pair of which was annotated by 2 annotators
 (200 situtaions * 2 annotators * 11 4.4k
annotations).
See Figure 14 for the MTurk template used. For this study,
only the set of values, rights, and duties was used, without
the explanation or valence scores shown, in order to disentangle
 the value, right, and duty generation from the other
aspects.
The interannotator agreement metrics are as follows 
For overall preference (Answer.pref), Fleiss  kappa  0.170,

M GPT-4 Values, Rights, Duties Prompt
System Message 
1Given a situation, try to reason
about its morality by breaking
down relevant values, rights, and
duties. Please generate any and
all potentially relevant values
that people may hold, even if
they sometimes oppose eachother.
2 3Values  These are the intrinsic
goods or ideals that people
pursue or cherish, such as
happiness, well-being, justice,
or freedom. Values are the
desirable qualities that people
may seek in their lives and in
the world. They are often the
guiding principles for
individuals and societies,
shaping goals, motivations, and
preferences.
4 5Rights  Rights are the entitlements
or claims that individuals haveagainst others or society, which
are usually based on moral or
legal grounds. These can be
positive rights (e.g., the right
to education, healthcare, or free
speech) or negative rights (e.g
., the right to not be harmed,
enslaved, or discriminated
against). Rights serve to protect
the fundamental interests of
individuals and establish certain
boundaries that others must
respect.
6 7Duties  Duties are the moral
obligations or responsibilities
that individuals owe to others or
to society at large. They are
categorical reasons for doing or
refraining from doing something,
independent of whether we want to
do or refrain from doing that
thing. Duties can be weighty
reasons, not easily overridden by
competing concerns, and their
violation may justify blame and
self-blame (guilt). Duties can
arise from relationships, social
roles, or moral principles, and
they guide our actions and
decisions.
8- Imperfect Duties  Some duties are
"imperfect," meaning they are
owed to no one in particular. For
example, a duty to be charitable
to the poor, but no specific
poor person can demand charity
from someone.
9- Perfect Duties  Some duties are   
perfect," meaning they are owed
to someone in particular. For
example, a duty not to plaigarize
someone s work. When someone
plagiarizes, there is a
particular person who has been
wronged - the person who was
plaigarized.
10 11For each value, right, and duty
output a 1-3 sentence explanation
of how it is related/expressed
in the situation.
12 13 14For each, list whether it supports
the action, opposes the action,
or could either support or oppose
. Additionally, for each duty,
list whether it is perfect orimperfect (but do not include the
word "perfect" or "imperfect" in
the explanation).
15 16If none are relevant, put N/A.
17 18 19 20-  {value1 OR N/A }  explanation1 [
supports/opposes/either]

Worker discretion is advised. Feel free to exit the task at any time.Thank you for participating in this HIT  It's important to read the instructions thoroughly before proceeding.Your task is to evaluate moral reasoning about specific actions based on values, rights, and duties as definedbelow Definitions     (Expand/Collapse)Values  These are the intrinsic goods or ideals that people pursue or cherish, such as happiness, well-being, justice, or freedom. Values are thedesirable qualities that people may seek in their lives and in the world. They are often the guiding principles for individuals and societies, shaping goals,motivations, and preferences.Rights  Rights are the entitlements or claims that individuals have against others or society, which are usually based on moral or legal grounds.These can be positive rights (e.g., the right to education, healthcare, or free speech) or negative rights (e.g., the right to not be harmed, enslaved, ordiscriminated against). Rights serve to protect the fundamental interests of individuals and establish certain boundaries that others must respect.Duties  Duties are the moral obligations or responsibilities that individuals owe to others or to society at large. They are categorical reasons fordoing or refraining from doing something, independent of whether we want to do or refrain from doing that thing. Duties can be weighty reasons, noteasily overridden by competing concerns, and their violation may justify blame and self-blame (guilt). Duties can arise from relationships, social roles,or moral principles, and they guide our actions and decisions.You'll evaluate the output (marked in purple) in two steps Task 1  Evaluate Output QualityFor each action, you will be presented with values, rights, and duties that make sense to consider when determining the morality of the action (see definitions below).Your job is to determine if these factors are high quality. A good output would be Relevant  The value/right/duty should be a relevant thing to consider when thinking about the action and fits the definition of value/right/duty.Sensible  The explanation should make sense and be coherent.Reasonable  Is it a reasonable thing to think  Even if you disagree with the explanation, could someone else find it reasonable Note  If you're unsure, go with your instincts. If you find yourself not coming across any bad examples, that's okay - it might just be the luck of the draw.Task 2  Evaluate Support or OppositionNext, you'll see a guess for each explanation on whether it supports doing the action, opposes doing the action, or could either support or oppose the actiondepending on the interpretation or context. Your job is to determine if this guess is correct based on the provided explanation.Missing OutputIf you feel that something is missing, you can check the "Missing value/right/duties " checkbox and write a few words about what's missing in the text box. It can beas long or as short as you like.We appreciate your attention to detail and thoughtful responses. Thank you for your contribution

SubmitAction${situation}Figure 15  Relevance, explanation, and valence annotation MTurk template.N Data Sheet
Here we include a Datasheet for Datasets (Gebru et al. 2018)
to document the dataset.
N.1 1) to understand what pluralistic
 human values, rights, and duties are already present in
large language models, and 2) to serve as a resource to to
support open, value pluralistic modeling (e.g., K ALEIDO ).
It contains human-written situations about which to reason
 and machine-generated candidate values, rights, duties,
along with their valences and post-hoc explanations relating
them to the situations.
What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for 
The situations could also be used as a rich, diverse dataset
of mostly everyday situations for further decision-making
work.
Are there obvious tasks for which it should not be
used 
The dataset should only be used for research purposes,
and should not be used for real-world decision-making, advice,
 or commercial applications.
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already 
The dataset has only been used so far to train K ALEIDO .
If so, where are the results so others can compare 
Results in body of this paper.
Who funded the creation of the dataset 
Funding for this dataset came from the DARPA ITM program
 and the Allen Institute for AI (AI2).
If there is an associated grant, provide the grant number.
FA8650-23-C-7316
N.2 Dataset Composition
What are the instances  Are there multiple types of instances 

Situations are plain-text English spans. Each one contains
several candidate values, rights, and duties, along with a valence
 relation (supports, opposes, either) and a free-text explanation.
 Statistics are found in Table 6.
For seq seq training, we take this data to make 4 subtask
splits  generation of a relevant value, right, or duty from a
situation, valence of a value, right, or duty in relation to a
situation, an explanation of how a value, right, or duty may
connect to a situation, and a set of positive and negative pairs
for determining whether a value, right, or duty is relevant for
a given action. For relevance, we use  was generated  as a
proxy for relevant, and negatively sample values, rights, and
duties that were generated for other situations. Statistics can
be found in 7.
Are relationships between instances made explicit in the
data 
There are no relationships between instances beyond the
fact that each situation has several seq seq tasks, which can
be trivially reconstructed.How many instances of each type are there 
Statistics in Table 7.
What data does each instance consist of   Raw 
data (e.g., unprocessed text or images)  Features/attributes 

Situations are raw free-text, but the rest of the dataset is
structured. All values, rights, and duties are free-text connected
 to a situation, along with a corresponding type (either
  Value ,  Right , or  Duty )  valences are connected to
a situation and specific value, right, or duty, and are of types
 Supports ,  Opposes , or  Either  supports or opposes  relevances
 are connected to a situation and specific value, right,
or duty, and are of type  Yes  or  No   and explanations
are free-text associated with a situation and particular value,
right, or duty.
Is there a label/target associated with instances  If the
instances are related to people, are subpopulations identified
 (e.g., by age, gender, etc.) and what is their distribution 

There are labels associated with instances for valence and
relevance. The instances are not related to people.
Is everything included or does the data rely on external
resources  (e.g., websites, tweets, datasets) If external resources,
 a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and
remain constant, over time  b) is there an official archival
version. Are there licenses, fees or rights associated with
any of the data 
Everything is included and does not rely on external resources.
 We intend the data for research use only under the
[] Taylor license
Are there recommended data splits or evaluation measures 
 (e.g., training, development, testing  accuracy/AUC)

Yes, there are recommended training, validation, and testing
 splits. We recommend and report accuracy for valence
and relevance, and perplexity for generation and explanation.

What experiments were initially run on this dataset 
Have a summary of those results and, if available, provide
 the link to a paper with more information here.
T5-based models were trained on splits of this data and
were tested on both the synthetic data (Section D) and were
assessed by humans (Sections 5.1 3). While the interested
 reader should defer to the paper for more results, humans
 found that the distilled models matched the test output
 quality for valence and explanation, surpassed the test
quality for generating sets of values, rights, and duties, and
output relevances that correlated with human judgments.
We also run two human studies on the dataset (Sections
4.1 and E). Crowdworkers agree the data is high-quality
91% of the time, and have trouble surfacing values, rights,
or duties that are missed, providing suggestions less than
1% of the time. Additionally, in an attempt to understand if
the dataset aligns best with any demographic groups, we recruit
 613 crowdworkers to mark personal agreement with thedata, and do not find significant takeaways for which groups
are represented best in the data.
N.3 Data Collection Process
How was the data collected  (e.g., hardware apparatus/sensor,
 manual human curation, software program,
software interface/API  how were these constructs/measures/methods
 validated )
The situations were provided by volunteer users of the
Delphi user demo, and the candidate values, rights, duties
and their corresponding relations were generated by a large
language model, GPT-4.
Who was involved in the data collection process  (e.g.,
students, crowdworkers) How were they compensated 
(e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid )
Data was collected and by the authors of the paper.
The dataset was not collected through crowdworkers, but
through demo users and the OpenAI API.
However, to understand the dataset s quality and representativeness,
 we do carry out several human studies on subsets
of the data (see Section 4.1 4.2). We ensured that, for all
tasks, crowdworkers were paid a minimum hourly wage of
$15-25 USD.
Over what time-frame was the data collected  Does the
collection time-frame match the creation time-frame 
The situations were collected from 2021-2023 on the Delphi
user demo, and the values, rights, and duties were generated
using the OpenAI API from May 2023-July 2023.
How was the data associated with each instance acquired 
 Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text,
movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses),
 or indirectly inferred/derived from other data
(e.g., part of speech tags  model-based guesses for age or
language)  If the latter two, were they validated/verified
and if so how 
The data is only associated in that the situations came
from the demo and the remaining data from the OpenAI API.
Does the dataset contain all possible instances  Or is it,
for instance, a sample (not necessarily random) from a
larger set of instances  If the dataset is a sample, then
what is the population  What was the sampling strategy
(e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling
probabilities)  Is the sample representative of the larger
set (e.g., geographic coverage)  If not, why not (e.g., to
cover a more diverse range of instances)  How does this
affect possible uses 
We source our 31 1.3M user-submitted situations, and curate the dataset
by filtering out situations that are not are not actions or unrelated
 to morality (as labeled in a few-shot manner by
Flan-T5 (Chung et al. 2022)). We also filter out any questions
 using keyword matching.
We note that an outsize proportion of the dataset involves
toxic, NSFW, or sexually explicit content. In the interest of
having a diversity of situations, we label for these attributes1 25Few-shot filtering prompts are found in Appendix M.1.using Flan-T5 (Chung et al. 2022). We take 95% of our situations
 determinnistically from those that have less toxic/NSFW/explicit
 content, and sample the other 5% uniformly
from the rest of the data so as to include the entire spectrum
 of inputs. We find that this succeeds in increasing the
diversity of the dataset, as measured by unique n-grams divided
 by the length of the dataset (dist-2  .23  .36, dist-3 
.54 .67).
Is there information missing from the dataset and why 
(this does not include intentionally dropped instances  it
might include, e.g., redacted text, withheld documents)
Is this data missing because it was unavailable 
No, there is no known data missing from the dataset, although
 we do not claim or believe that the dataset is necessarily
 a comprehensive set of representative human values.
Are there any known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies
 in the data 
No known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies, although
 we hope future work will help to shed more light on
weaknesses.
N.4 Data Preprocessing
What preprocessing/cleaning was done  (e.g., discretization
 or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging,
SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing
 of missing values, etc.)
The main preprocessing was extraction of the features
from raw text output from GPT-4 to the semi-structured
dataset that we have. We used regex expressions for this extraction.

Was the  raw  data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned
 data  (e.g., to support unanticipated future
 uses)
Yes, the raw GPT-4 outputs were saved in addition to the
cleaned data.
Is the preprocessing software available 
Yes, all preprocessing software will be available at https 
//github.com/tsor13/kaleido.
Does this dataset collection/processing procedure achieve
the motivation for creating the dataset stated in the first
section of this datasheet 
It achieves the goal of 1) trying to understand what pluralistic
 human values, rights, and duties are currently embedded
 in GPT-4 (although not other LLMs). It achieves the
goal of taking a first step to modeling human values, rights,
and duties computationally, as manifested by K ALEIDO , but
we do not claim that it necessarily does so with accuracy and
complete representativeness.
N.5 Dataset Distribution
How is the dataset distributed  (e.g., website, API, etc. 
does the data have a DOI  is it archived redundantly )
We plan on distributing the dataset via Huggingface
Datasets, but it will be gated for individual-approval and intended
 for research-use only in an attempt to prevent misuse.When will the dataset be released/first distributed  (Is
there a canonical paper/reference for this dataset )
We plan on distributng the dataset in September 2023,
with this manuscript as a reference.
What license (if any) is it distributed under  Are there
any copyrights on the data 
We plan on distributing V ALUE PRISM under the ImpACT
license (Allen Insitute for AI 2023) as a  medium-risk artifact .
 Users must agree to all terms and restrictions of the
license before accessing or using the dataset.
Are there any fees or access/export restrictions 
No, the dataset is distributed at no cost. However, we do
gate access by individual request and access is predicated on
acceptance of the license.
N.6 Dataset Maintenance
Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset 
How does one contact the owner/curator/manager of the
dataset (e.g. email address, or other contact info) 
The Allen Institute for AI supports the dataset and it
will be hosted on Huggingface. Corresponding authors are
Taylor Sorensen ( tsor13@cs.washington.edu ) and
Yejin Choi ( yejin@cs.washington.edu ).
Will the dataset be updated  How often and by whom 
How will updates/revisions be documented and communicated
 (e.g., mailing list, GitHub)  Is there an erratum 

We do not plan on updating the dataset.
If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be communicated 
 Is there a repository to link to any/all papers/systems
 that use this dataset 
We do not expect the dataset to become obselete as it
does not depend on external sources. Users of V ALUE PRISM
should cite this manuscript.
If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset,
is there a mechanism for them to do so  If so, is there
a process for tracking/assessing the quality of those contributions.
 What is the process for communicating/distributing
 these contributions to users 
As of now, there is no formal mechanism to extend/augment/build
 on this dataset, but anyone interested should
reach out to the authors.
N.7 Legal & Ethical Considerations
If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or
was generated by people, were they informed about the
data collection  (e.g., datasets that collect writing, photos,
 interactions, transactions, etc.)
Users of the Delphi user demo explicitly agreed that their
queries could be recorded and used for research purposes,
and the rest of the data was machine-generated.
If it relates to other ethically protected subjects, have appropriate
 obligations been met  (e.g., medical data might
include information collected from animals)
It does not relate to other ethically protected subjects.If it relates to people, were there any ethical review applications/reviews/approvals 
 (e.g. Institutional Review
Board applications) If it relates to people, were they told
what the dataset would be used for and did they consent 
 What community norms exist for data collected
from human communications  If consent was obtained,
how  Were the people provided with any mechanism to
revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses 
Data does not relate directly to people.
If it relates to people, could this dataset expose people to
harm or legal action  (e.g., financial social or otherwise)
What was done to mitigate or reduce the potential for
harm 
Data does not relate directly to people.
If it relates to people, does it unfairly advantage or disadvantage
 a particular social group  In what ways  How
was this mitigated 
Data does not relate directly to people.
If it relates to people, were they provided with privacy
guarantees  If so, what guarantees and how are these ensured 

Data does not relate directly to people.
Does the dataset comply with the EU General Data Protection
 Regulation (GDPR)  Does it comply with any
other standards, such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity
 Act 
Especially because the data does not relate to people
or have personally identifiable information, it does comply
with these laws.
Does the dataset contain information that might be considered
 sensitive or confidential  (e.g., personally identifying
 information) Does the dataset contain information
that might be considered inappropriate or offensive 
No, the dataset does not contain sensitive or confidential
information (like personally identifiable information). The
dataset does potentially contain inappropriate or offensive
text, especially in the demo-sourced situations, and we advise
 that the dataset is not for all eyes before providing access.
 While we did not want to completely remove inappropriate
 or offensive situations so that the model could perform
well in surfacing relevant values, rights, and duties in these
cases, we did attempt to ensure that the generated data does
not include inappropriate or offensive content via manual inspection
 and toxicity filters.
