## TITLE
The CHiME-7 DASR Challenge: Distant Meeting Transcription with Multiple Devices in Diverse Scenarios
## ABSTRACT
The CHiME challenges have played a significant role in the development and evaluation of robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We introduce the CHiME-7 distant ASR (DASR) task, within the 7th CHiME challenge. This task comprises joint ASR and diarization in far-field settings with multiple, and possibly heterogeneous, recording devices. Different from previous challenges, we evaluate systems on 3 diverse scenarios: CHiME-6, DiPCo, and Mixer 6. The goal is for participants to devise a single system that can generalize across different array geometries and use cases with no a-priori information. Another departure from earlier CHiME iterations is that participants are allowed to use open-source pre-trained models and datasets. In this paper, we describe the challenge design, motivation, and fundamental research questions in detail. We also present the baseline system, which is fully array-topology agnostic and features multi-channel diarization, channel selection, guided source separation and a robust ASR model that leverages self-supervised speech representations (SSLR).

Abstract
The CHiME challenges have played a significant role in the development
 and evaluation of robust automatic speech recognition
 (ASR) systems. We introduce the CHiME-7 distant ASR
(DASR) task, within the 7th CHiME challenge. This task comprises
 joint ASR and diarization in far-field settings with multiple,
 and possibly heterogeneous, recording devices. Different
from previous challenges, we evaluate systems on 3 diverse scenarios 
 CHiME-6, DiPCo, and Mixer 6. The goal is for participants
 to devise a single system that can generalize across different
 array geometries and use cases with no a-priori information.
Another departure from earlier CHiME iterations is that participants
 are allowed to use open-source pre-trained models and
datasets. In this paper, we describe the challenge design, motivation,
 and fundamental research questions in detail. We also
present the baseline system, which is fully array-topology agnostic
 and features multi-channel diarization, channel selection,
guided source separation and a robust ASR model that leverages
self-supervised speech representations (SSLR).

1. Introduction
Despite significant leaps made in the last decade, reliable
conversational speech recognition remains a significant challenge
 [1,2]. This is particularly true in meeting scenarios which
are often constrained to use only distant array devices [1, 3 6].
Besides difficulties due to noise and reverberation in far-field
speech, in meeting scenarios a crucial challenge is the presence
of overlapped speech, which may amount to more than 15% of
total conversation [7]. A third issue are linguistic artifacts arising
 from informal settings or domain-specific words, an often
disregarded characteristic in ASR research, as most commonly
used benchmark datasets feature scripted or semi-scripted conversations
 [2].
As these difficulties arise from diverse factors, multi-talker
distant conversational speech recognition requires a comprehensive
 approach for the development and integration of both
front-end and ASR back-end techniques. Over the years, several
 challenges and corpora have played a significant role in
advancing research in this field. These include, but are not
limited to, ASpiRE [8], AMI [9], ICSI [10], the CHiME (1 
4) challenges [11 14], the Sheffield Wargames corpus [15],
and DIRHA [16]. More recently, we have seen VOiCES [17],
DiPCo [18], LibriCSS [3], Alimeeting [19], Ego4D [20], and
the recent CHiME 5 and 6 challenges [1, 21].
Several of these datasets/challenges, such as DIRHA,
VOiCES, and CHiME-4, focused primarily on acoustic robustness,
 thus featuring pre-segmented single speaker utterances ina noisy/reverberant environment captured by multiple microphones.
 The objective in this case was to foster research in
robust ASR methods, ignoring possible issues that can arise
from overlapped speech, wrong segmentation, and colloquial
language. These datasets comprised either fully simulated or
semi-real environments, where utterances come from an audiobook
 speech corpus such as LibriSpeech [22]. A notable exception
 in this regard is LibriCSS. It features a simulated, unsegmented
 full meeting scenario between multiple participants
in semi-real conditions  it was obtained by playing LibriSpeech
utterances via loudspeakers in a real room.
AMI, ICSI, and Sheffield Wargames were historically
among the first projects that featured real unsegmented meetingstyle
 scenarios recorded in far-field settings. Although these are
more expensive to collect compared with simulated or semireal
 datasets, they better reflect possible real-world applications.
Recently, this line of research has seen renewed interest, and has
resulted in the collection and creation of datasets such as CHiME-5/6,
 DiPCo, Alimeeting, and Ego4D. The progress made
in ASR, diarization and speech separation is a significant contributing
 factor to this trend, and it suggests that reliable and
robust transcription in these scenarios is within our reach in the
coming years.
The proposed CHiME-7 DASR challenge1follows this latter
 line of research on real, unsegmented meeting scenarios.
Our main goal is to foster research in an important direction 
how can we build systems that can generalize across a wide
range of real-world settings and provide reliable ASR performance
 under adverse acoustic conditions  Additionally, we aim
to incorporate recent progresses in self-supervised learning to
address this problem as well as supervised DNN-based speech
separation and enhancement (SSE), by allowing the use of external
 data and pre-trained models.
2. Motivation
Compared to the previous CHiME editions, CHiME-7 DASR
features three main novelties, motivated by recent promising directions
 in speech processing.
2.1. Diverse Scenarios
To expand the breadth of evaluation conditions, we include two
additional datasets (along with CHiME-6)   DiPCo [18], and
Mixer 6 Speech [23]. The objective is to encourage research towards
 methods that (1) work well across different array topologies 
 linear (CHiME-6), circular (DiPCo), or heterogeneous
(Mixer 6)  (2) are capable of handling variable numbers of
speakers in each session  (3) account for linguistic differences
1CHiME-7 DASR website  chimechallenge.org/current/task1/indexarXiv 2306.13734v2  [eess.AS]  14 Jul 2023between dinner party scenarios (CHiME-6 and DiPCo) versus
interviews (Mixer 6)  and (4) can effectively handle diverse
acoustic conditions. Such variability reflects real use-cases
where such cross-domain generalization capability is highly desirable.

2.2.  Foundation  Models
Pre-trained speech models trained on large datasets are increasingly
 becoming available to the public. These include
supervised models such as OpenAI Whisper [24], Nvidia
JASPER [25] and QuartzNet [26], and self-supervised ones
such as Wav2Vec 2.0 [27], HuBERT [28], and WavLM [29].
The latter, in particular, have proved effective in many downstream
 applications [30], and their integration with front-end
speech enhancement has enabled state-of-the-art performance
on benchmarks such as CHiME-4 [31, 32]. Leveraging these
models offers unique opportunities as well as novel challenges.
By allowing the use of pre-trained models, the CHiME-7 DASR
task becomes more accessible to participants with limited resources,
 since training is often more efficient and quicker with
such models. While SSLR models can be quite large, the features
 could be pre-extracted, thus enabling significant computational
 savings in the training phase. From a research perspective,
 it may be interesting to investigate how such models, which
are trained in monoaural conditions, can make effective use of
multi-channel audio and/or can be distilled into smaller models.
2.3. Open-Source Datasets
The allowable external data sources are expanded to include
 many commonly used open-source datasets (e.g. LibriSpeech
 [22] and FSD50k [33]). They facilitate the use of
models for which, in prior challenges, necessary training data
were lacking, but also enables the study of new research directions.
 For example, participants can create large synthetic
datasets to train powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based
speech separation and enhancement (SSE) [34, 35]. The structure
 of the challenge then encourages research into whether
such models can effectively help improving real-world meeting
transcription. This latter research direction also intersects with
this year s  sister  CHiME-7 UDASE challenge, whose focus
is on unsupervised domain adaptation for speech enhancement.
3. Challenge Tracks & Rules
The CHiME-7 DASR challenge features two tracks   a main
track, and an optional sub-track, as described below.
3.1. Main Track
For the main track, we provide multi-channel recordings for
the whole session without segmentation or speaker labels, and
participants are required to generate time-marked, speakerattributed
 transcripts, as shown in Fig. 1. For any session, let
ri  (  , s,v)denote a time-marked, speaker-attributed transcript
 of a segment, where     ( tst, ten)is a tuple containing
start and end times, s Z is the speaker label2, andv Σ 
represents the transcript for the segment, for some vocabulary
Σ. A session is then completely defined by R {r1, . . . ,rN},
which we call the reference . Challenge participants are required
to estimate the reference through generated hypothesis , denoted
byH {h1, . . . ,hˆN}.
2Actual label names may be arbitrary, but can be mapped to the set
of positive integers without loss of generality.

Optimal speaker assignments are first determined using a DERbased
 evaluation, and then used to compute SA-WER, which is
used as the final ranking metric.
In this challenge, estimated speaker labels ˆsare not required
to be identical to the reference labels. This flexibility poses a
challenge in computing speaker-attributed word error rates (SAWER)
 since, unlike earlier studies [36], the mapping between
reference and estimated labels is not known.
We solve this problem using mechanisms employed in the
evaluation of diarization systems, as shown in Fig. 1. Let
Ψ  Z  Z   {ϕ}denote a mapping from the reference labels
 to the estimated labels. We use the Hungarian method [37]
to obtain the optimal mapping ˆΨthat minimizes the diarization
error rate (DER) between the reference segments and hypothesized
 segments, i.e.,
ˆΨ   arg min
ΨDER(R,H), (1)
where the DER is calculated with a 250ms collar, following the
setup in CHiME-6. Given ˆΨ, we compute this newly proposed
diarization attributed WER (DA-WER) metric as
DA-WER (R,H)  P
sL( Rs,  HˆΨ(s))P
s  Rs , (2)
where Rsdenotes segments in Rwith speaker s,Lis the
Levenshtein distance, and the  operator concatenates segment
 transcripts of its operand. Final ranking of systems will
be based on the DA-WER metric macro-averaged across all
scenarios. The macro-average operation is to encourage participants
 to develop a model whose performance is consistent
across all three scenarios. Note that this evaluation is different
from the concatenated minimum-permutation WER (cpWER)
based ranking in the CHiME-6 challenge, since it requires participants
 to also produce estimates of the utterances boundaries.
Utterance boundaries estimation are important in actual applications,
 e.g. for double checking the transcripts. It also differs
from the Asclite multi-dimensional Levenshtein metric [38],
which can account for segmentation errors when the time-based
cost is used. Contrary to this latter, DA-WER does not require
 word-level alignment, which is quite time-consuming to
double-check for ground-truth purposes. DA-WER instead offers
 a simple and  loose  way to encourage participants to produce
 reasonable segmentation at the utterance level, which is
sufficient in most applications. Future work is needed to devise
more principled metrics for joint ASR and diarization.
3.2. Optional Sub-Track
Similar to the CHiME-6 challenge, we include an optional subtrack
 where participants can use oracle diarization. The goal
of this sub-track is to assess the acoustic front-end and ASR
performance and disentangle it from the impact of diarization.
The segmentation and speaker labels are known and are freely
usable by participants, here the problem reduces to a standardASR task.
3.3. Rules
Detailed description of the task rules are available in the CHiME-7
 DASR website3. Hereafter we briefly summarize them.
  Only some external data and pre-trained models are allowed.
Participants are encouraged to propose additional ones in the
first month.
  Close-talk microphones cannot be used for inference.
 Automatic domain identification is prohibited . This includes
the use of a-priori information such as array topology (including
 number of channels). A single system must be submitted
for all three scenarios.
  Automatic channel selection is allowed and encouraged.
 Self-supervised adaptation/training is allowed , as long as it is
performed for each evaluation session independently i.e. as it
would happen in a real-world deployment.
  Participants may use all available data (including external
data) for language model training, but cannot use large language
 models (LM) such as BERT [39]. This because we
want participants to focus mainly on acoustic robustness.
4. Datasets
As explained in Section 2, CHiME-7 DASR is composed of
three different scenarios/datasets  CHiME-6, DiPCo, and Mixer
6 Speech. For the purpose of this challenge, several changes
have been made to these aforementioned data sources. In particular,
 we partially re-annotated Mixer 6 and we harmonized
the transcripts across each of the three by using the same convention
 for common non-verbal speech sounds such as  mhm ,
 mmh ,  hmm , which are rather frequent. Dataset statistics
are summarized in Table 1. The annotation comes in the form
of JSON files (one for each session), in the style of CHiME-6
(see Listing 1). Hereafter, we describe each scenario in more
detail.
Table 1  CHiME-7 DASR data overview for the three scenarios.
 For the CHiME-6 data, we show statistics for the original
annotation, as well as a force-aligned (FA) annotation. We report
 the number of utterances, speakers, and sessions, as well
as silence (sil), single-speaker speech (1-spk) and overlapped
speech (ovl) ratios over the total duration.

4.1. CHiME-6
The CHiME-6 dataset features real dinner parties with 4 participants
 in a home environment, usually across different rooms.
Due to the particular setting, it features informal speech and
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recordings from binaural microphones
 worn by each speaker are provided along with distant
 speech captured by 6 Kinect array devices with 4 micro3chimechallenge.org/current/task1/rulesphones
 each for a total of 24 microphones. Two annotations
are provided [1], one manual and another obtained via forced
alignment (FA)4. In CHiME-7 DASR, we retain the CHiME-6
dataset in its original form, with the exception that two sessions
were moved from the original train set to the eval set. This in
order to have a bigger eval set, with more variety in acoustical
conditions, compared to the CHiME-6 challenge. Importantly,
we can still reasonably compare results with the previous challenge
 ones, on the devset and the original portion from eval .
We also provide universal evaluation map (UEM) files to exclude
 the speaker enrollment from evaluation, a feature missing
from the previous iteration which incorrectly scored this portion
as silence.

4.2. DiPCo
DiPCo consists of 10 recorded dinner party sessions, each between
 4 speakers, recorded on 5 far-field devices each with a
7-mic circular array (six plus one microphone at the center).
Per-speaker close-talk microphones are provided, and have less
cross-talk than the corresponding mics from CHiME-6 . Additionally,
 each session has a lower duration (15 47 mins) and is
recorded in the same single room. Importantly, the additional
DiPCo data allows us to evaluate participants  submissions in
a  best-case scenario   where the acoustic conditions between
training and testing are reasonably matched.
4.3. Mixer 6 Speech
The Mixer 6 Speech set (LDC catalog no. LDC2013S03) features
 a very different but relevant multi-speaker, multi-channel
scenario. It consists of 594 distinct native English speakers participating
 in a total of 1425 sessions, each lasting approximately
45 minutes. Sessions include an interview between an  interviewer 
 and a  subject  (15 min.), a telephone call (10 min.),
and prompt reading. Each session is recorded using 14 microphones
 of varying styles, placed in various locations around one
of 2 different rooms ( LDCandHRM).
We make use of the interview and call portions of 450
of the 1425 sessions for which we have collected humanannotated
 transcriptions. The remaining audio in the 450 sessions,
 for which no human annotation is available, can be used
by the participants, for instance, to support unsupervised or selfsupervised
 training. The 450 sessions are split into train ,dev,
andeval partitions with no speaker overlap. We only use 13 of
the channels in the challenge as the SNR of the 14th channel is
too low to be useful (or intelligible).
Human-annotated time-marks and transcripts are available
only for the  subject , who is usually the dominant speaker. For
the  interviewer  segments, preliminary transcripts were generated
 by running Whisper [40] large inference on the lapel microphone
 ( eval ), or via manual annotation ( dev). Interviewer
transcripts were then force-aligned with the audio from the interviewer s
 lapel microphone (for dev) and/or manually cor4chimechallenge/CHiME7
 DASR falignrected (for eval ) to get the ground-truth annotations. Information
 about the splits is shown in Table 1. Note that eval was
recorded in the ( HRM) room  this new room condition tests robustness
 to shifts in the recording room, while performance on
devrepresents a more matched scenario. Close-talk channels
are not provided to challenge participants for eval .
5. Baseline Description
The CHiME-7 DASR baseline model is shown in Fig. 2. For the
main track, it features an array topology agnostic speech processing
 pipeline composed of multi-channel diarization, channel
 selection, guided source separation (GSS) [41], and monaural
 ASR.

Figure 2  Block scheme for the CHiME-7 DASR baseline. The
diarizer module is omitted in the acoustic robustness sub-track.
For the optional sub-track, the diarizer component is omitted
 since participants are provided oracle segmentation. This
baseline system, along with the data preparation, is implemented
 within ESPNet2 [42] as a recipe5. We now describe
each component in detail.
5.1. Front-End Processing
The baseline system for the CHiME-6 challenge comprised
GSS for front-end processing [41], with array topology aware
choices such as the use of outer microphones. Since CHiME7
 DASR forbids the a-priori knowledge of array geometry, we
instead use automatic channel selection using an envelope variance
 (EV) approach as proposed in [43]. This measure, while
simple, has been found to be effective on CHiME-6 data [44]
where it compared favourably with more elaborated data-driven
approaches. Channel selection is used to select the most promising
 subset of microphones for each utterance for later processing
 via GSS. We use a GPU-accelerated implementation of
GSS [45] that allows to significantly speed up the inference
time (e.g. up to 300x on CHiME-6 development data with two
NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs).
5.2. Diarization
During preliminary experiments with the Pyannote [46] diarization
 pipeline6on CHiME-6, we found that diarization error
rate (DER) between microphones belonging to the same array
may vary by up to 10%. This agrees with similar observations
made during the CHiME-6 challenge, where teams employed
channel fusion methods to subvert these effects [47]. At the
same time, low speaker variability in CHiME-6 and the lack of
train segmentation for the interviewer segments in Mixer-6 prohibit
 methods such as EEND-VC [48] and suggest the use of
embedding-based approaches, unless one wants to create extensive
 multi-channel synthetic data.
For these reasons, here we opt for a simple but reasonably
effective approach built over the Pyannote [46] diarization system,
 which is very popular and has been proven to be success5espnet/tree/chime7task1

ful on a wide variety of scenarios. Our approach is depicted in
Figure 3. In detail, instead of channel ensembling, we instead
leverage the local end-to-end diarization (EEND) [49,50] module
 in the pipeline [46] for channel selection. The maximum
number of local speakers is fixed to 3 and we use 5 s segments.
Only this latter is ran over all channels and, assuming it is robust
against false alarms, we select the channel which has the most
speech activity as the best channel. The rest of the pipeline (including
 embedding extraction and clustering, which make the
bulk of computation) is then run only over this selected microphone
 channel, leading to a significant speed up versus running
the whole pipeline over all channels. This approach has obviously
 its limitations, e.g. for two concurrent speakers it may
be preferable to select a different microphone for each. Despite
this limitation, we found it to work very well on the devset, significantly
 outperforming all channels ensembling via DOVERLap
 [51] (40% versus 52% DER on CHiME-6 devset). This
said, this simple approach can be easily extended in the future
to use the top-K channels instead of just one in the clustering
phase.
In the baseline recipe, we fine-tune the local EEND model
of the Pyannote pipeline using all CHiME-6 train set (by using
 all far-field channels only) and use for validation Mixer 6
dev set  only this latter is used because Mixer 6 is the most
acoustically different dataset among the three scenarios from
CHiME-6, so it made sense to use it as validation, to enforce
early-stopping and preventing overfitting. To make the output
of the diarization more suitable for ASR we post-process the
diarization output by merging segments from the same speaker
which are 0.5 seconds apart. The pre-trained model is made
available via HuggingFace7.
5.3. Automatic Speech Recognition
For the baseline ASR, we directly take the model from [31,32],
which consists of a hybrid CTC/Attention transformer [52]
encoder-decoder ASR model with WavLM-based features and
has been proven very effective on noisy-reverberant data. It
is trained on the full CHiME-6 train (including the binaural
microphones) and the Mixer 6 train . In addition, we used
the augmentation scFheme as described in the CHiME-6 baseline
 [1], which leveraged close-talk microphones and external
datasets for RIRs and noises, namely SLR26 [53] and MUSAN
 [54]. We also used GSS-enhanced data obtained from the
whole CHiME-6 training set. Both these addition were found
critical to reach state-of-the-art performance. The training takes
approximately 18 hours using two A100 GPUs on a DGXA100
machine. This model is made available via HuggingFace8

6. Results & Discussion
6.1. Front-End Processing
As mentioned in Sec. 5.1, a key difference between the frontend
 module in CHiME-7 DASR, compared with the CHiME-6
challenge, is the use of automatic channel selection. In Fig. 4,
we show WER results and inference time on the devsets for
different selection ratios when the ASR is trained using data
containing GSS performed with all channels.
We can observe two trends. First, the time employed to perform
 selection GSS appears to be approximately linear with the
number of microphones used. Secondly, the error rate generally
decreases as the number of microphones used increases. Thus
there appears to be a trade-off between computational complexity
 and performance. In particular, the best performance for
CHiME-6 and DiPCo is achieved by using the top 80%, while
Mixer 6 will benefit from the use of all microphones. This could
be related to the fact that Mixer 6 is less noisy and all channels
might contribute significantly to improving the GSS result. In
the baseline we always use the top 80% channels for GSS for
both training and inference, as this seems to maximize the performance
 overall.
6.2. Diarization
In Table 2 we report the results achieved by our proposed diarization
 system in terms of DER and Jaccard error rate (JER)
with250ms collar. We can see that, overall, the system, despite
being fine-tuned only on CHiME-6 data, generalizes well to the
other scenarios.

scenario-wise results as well as the macro-average.

Macro 28.8 38.5 31.2 38.2
CHiME-6 remains by far the most difficult scenarios among
the three for what regards diarization, due to the challenging
acoustical conditions and frequent overlapped speech.
6.3. Overall Results
In Table 3 we present DA-WER figures obtained on the three
CHiME-7 DASR scenarios, for both sub-track ( sub) and maintrack
 ( main ), together with their macro averages. We compare
 our baseline model against Whisper [24] large   note thatWhisper cannot be used by participants as it was not included
among the allowed pre-trained models (its training data may
contain our evaluation). Nevertheless, it serves as an interesting
and strong point of comparison.

best configuration from development set (80% channels GSS).

Mixer 6 21.2 23.7 25.2 35.8
Macro 28.8 44.8 32.5 53.2
Overall, our baseline ASR model compares favorably with
Whisper large especially in the acoustic robustness sub-track
where the final macro-average DA-WER scores are very close.
In the main track the difference is more pronounced, and Whisper
 appears slightly more robust to segmentation errors, due to
its significantly larger training data.
By comparing sub and main columns in Table 3, we can
observe that diarization has a big impact on the final recognition
 score. We discovered that the permutation was always assigned
 correctly in these results during DA-WER computation,
yet, sub-optimal segmentation and mis-attributed sentences degraded
 considerably the performance, especially on CHiME-6.
On the other hand, we can see how both Whisper and the baseline
 system fail, even with oracle diarization, to reach satisfactory
 performance suitable for real-world applications, even on
the arguably easier Mixer 6 scenario.
7. Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced the CHiME-7 DASR challenge,
which builds upon the past CHiME-6 and extends it to multiple
 scenarios which feature diverse array topologies, number of
participants, acoustical conditions and linguistic differences, to
test meeting transcription systems cross-domain generalization
capability. Other novelties regard the use of a novel DA-WER
metric which also accounts implicitly for diarization accuracy
and the allowance for pre-trained  foundation  models and popular
 external datasets. Despite the efforts in developing a solid
baseline system, the proposed challenge scenario still poses significant
 obstacles in achieving accurate transcriptions  this is
also demonstrated by results with Whisper large and oracle diarization.
 Our hope is that participants will devise novel and
more effective ways to address this important problem.
