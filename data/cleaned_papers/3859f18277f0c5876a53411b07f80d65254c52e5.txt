Abstract
Second language acquisition (SLA) is complex and multidimensional. Using the frame work
 of the unified competition model (UCM), the current study explores how robust
learning and testing of Chinese Pinyin are fostered by optimal integration of differ ent
 kinds of feedback in an intelligent computer-assisted language learning (CALL)
environment offered by the Pinyin Tutor at TalkBank. The findings demonstrated
that the repeated feedback-embedded training with the Pinyin Tutor significantly
boosted the learners  proficiency in all aspects of Pinyin knowledge for second language
 (L2) learners of Chinese whose first language (L1) backgrounds were varied
and whose initial proficiencies in Chinese were elementary. Furthermore, there
was a strong increase in Pinyin knowledge, as evidenced in the delayed posttest
administered 3 months after finishing the training sessions. The results further showed
that diagnostic feedback led to greater improvement than basic feedback. The significance
 of the results is attributed to the design of the Pinyin Tutor, which implements
principles from psycholinguistic theory as well as corpus data on the speech production
 by L2 learners. The study sheds fresh light on improving the Pinyin Tutor, and CALL
in general, by incorporating up-to-date findings in educational psychology.

Introduction
As hypothesized by the unified competition model (UCM), second language acquisition
(SLA) is a complex and multidimensional process, involving the dynamic interactions
of a large number of forces and constraints with different magnitudes operating across
various timescales (MacWhinney, 2012, 2018, 2021). According to the UCM, the main
objective of language education, assessment, and curriculum design should be to foster
various protective factors while mitigating various risk factors, with detailed individual *Correspondence

differences being taken into account (MacWhinney, 2015, 2018  Pawlak, 2019, 2022).
The UCM emphasizes parallels between first language (L1) acquisition and second lan guage
 (L2) acquisition. However, what is different for these two types of learners is the
dramatically different learning environments they are facing and, correspondingly, the
vastly varied substantialities and contributions of all the protective or detrimental fac tors
 in shaping overall learning performance (MacWhinney, 2018).
There is no doubt that acquistion of a native-like accent is more difficult for L2 2 after puberty (Hartshorne et al., 2018  Guion et al., 2000  Flege,
1995  Patkowski, 1990  Johnson & Newport, 1989  Hernandez et al., 2005). This is per haps
 even more true for the acquisition of Chinese pronunciation of both segments and
tones. Studies show that the attainment of native proficiency in Chinese pronunciation,
including both tones and segments, is extremely difficult for L2 learners of Chinese who
begin learning after childhood (Hu, 2010  Qi et al., 2015  Stickler & Shi, 2013). While
there have been a variety of learning models (e.g., contrastive analysis by Lado, 1957 
markedness differential hypothesis, Eckman, 1981, 1991) attempting to interpret this
age-related phenomenon, the UCM emphasizes the roles of (1) the entrenchment of
auditory perception and motor forms, (2) overload of neurocognitive capacities of adult
learners by irrelevant or competing tasks, and (3) the lack of the instructional and social
support in comparison with the young learners in learning an L1. The problems faced by
L2 learners are gradient rather than absolute, as there have been empirical studies indi cating
 some adult L2 learners can achieve native-like pronunciation (Hartshorne et al.,
2018  Huang, 2015).
Input and training are indispensable for achieving native-like speaking in L2, as this
is fundamentally an entropy-reversing process where various risk factors must be con stantly
 overcome at every stage of learning. Feedback has been argued as one of the most
critical learning strategies across all learning modes, regardless of classroom instruc tion
 or remote learning, and for the acquisition of all categories of linguistic abilities,
including reading, writing, and speaking (Gebril, 2021  Li, 2020  Bitchener, 2008  Kang
& Han, 2015  Lyster, 2015). Zhang (2020) demonstrated that, in the long run, reflective
feedback is more effective than corrective feedback and rule-based feedback in helping
the L2 learning of Chinese classifiers. Li (2010, 2015), for example, provided a metaanalysis
 on feedback research, showing that, with both oral and written samples under
investigation, explicit feedback worked better than implicit feedback over a short time.
A positive effect on SLA learning is critically dependent on feedback quality, which may
include considerations such as the feedback s contents and design, types, and timing (Li
& Roshan, 2019  Kang & Han, 2015  Zhang & Li, 2016  Fu & Li, 2022  Li, 2020).
A robust CALL platform adopted in the current study is the Pinyin Tutor developed
and maintained under TalkBank at Carnegie Mellon University (www.  TalkB  ank. org). In
correcting the shortcomings of many existing CALL systems, the design of the Pinyin
Tutor has been based on the authentic learning corpus of thousands of L2 learners 
learning profiles and datasets. Learners  error patterns in the tutor were rigorously ana lyzed
 and categorized based on the theoretical phonological contrast analysis between
Chinese and other major languages such as English, Korean, and Cantonese (Kowalski
et al., 2014). Data on error patterns were updated as new data streamed in from all the
registered learners across more than one-hundred colleges and universities across the Page 3 22
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35

USA and other countries worldwide. This corpus-driven and learner-centered design
made it possible to investigate how learning can be optimized in the CALL environment.
Recent research (Zhang & MacWhinney, 2023) provided strong evidence that the Pinyin
Tutor, by adopting training stimuli with differentiated levels of novelty, can significantly
enhance the acquisition of Chinese phonetic knowledge among L2 learners of Chinese
with varied proficiencies and backgrounds.
When benchmarking the robustness of the Pinyin Tutor, it is crucial to examine the
effects of feedback. Feedback helps to boost the cue strength and resonant connections
of the orthographic and auditory forms of a word while suppressing competition from
incorrect alternatives (MacWhinney, 1991). Phonology-orthography mappings pro vide
 a significant source of resonance in L2 learning for alphabetic languages. However,
language learners with Roman scripts find it difficult to utilize the same source when
learning Chinese through Hanzi characters (MacWhinney, 2008). The Pinyin Tutor
introduced in the current study helps to overcome such challenges by relying on Pinyin,
rather than Hanzi. The training offered by the tutor is expected to show an advantage
in learning the mapping of oral Chinese to its graphic representation. We expect that
feedback should work together with resonant practice to enhance and consolidate the
learning of Chinese as an L2.
Theoretical framework and literature
Researchers have proposed several major theories to understand the development of
L2 phonological categories and processes. One prominent theory for L2 speech devel opment
 and learning is the native language magnet (NLM) model (Kuhl, 1991, 1998,
2000). The NLM model assumes a fixed developmental sequence of speech perception
from infant to adult, i.e., from language-universal phase to language-specific. Infants
map acoustic sounds from the input of the environment and gradually form the spe cific
 speech processing system, subserving a filter for the L1 perception and production.
Accordingly, the phonetic category of the infant s first language functions as the proto type
 of the infant s neurophonological system, magnetizing the nearby constituents to
the formed category. Once this language-specific mental network is formed, the acquisi tion
 of L2 2 2 input. The main pitfall of the NLM is its overestimation of the
L1 entrenchment and lack of attention to the influence of instructional strategies and
language input on the attainable level of SLA (Flege, 2018  Pawlak, 2019  MacWhinney,
2018).
Two other major approaches to the learning of L2 phonology are the perceptual
assimilation model (PAM) (Best, 1994, 1995  Best & Tyler, 2007) and the speech learn ing
 model (SLM) (Flege, 1995). Both models concern how similarity in sounds between
two languages may affect L2 acquisition, especially at the early stage of L2 learning. The
PAM assumes that adult listeners with developed phonological categories perceive L2 1 phonemes (Best, 1994). The L2 1 2 phonemes if they have
very similar phonological properties. Therefore, what is most likely to occur during the
learning is that the listener will assimilate the L2 1 4 22 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35
perceived to be most similar. The SLM emphasizes that whether an L2 1 2 sounds.
The model also observes that speech perception ability changes over the ages of the
learner in that learner of older ages typically perceives and produces L2 articulations less
accurately than the younger.
The revised version of the SLM (Flege & Bohn, 2021) extends the SLM in ways that
are highly compatible with the UCM. Both theories emphasize the role of amount of L2
input, rather than simply the numbers of years in the L2 community, and both theories
emphasize the critical roles of individual difference factors in motivation and L1 ability.
Like the UCM, the SLM attributes contrastive effects to the interaction and competition
between L1 2 systems. In addition to these large areas of agreement between SLM
and UCM, the UCM focuses on the role of the psychological processes of entrenchment,
resonance, chunking, and overanalysis and the ways in which risk factors and protec tive
 factors vary across linguistic levels, including but not limitedd to phonology. For
the purposes of the current study, the most important dimensions of the UCM are those
that focus on the role of feedback, resonance, and entrenchment (MacWhinney, 2015,
2018, 2021  Zhang & MacWhinney, 2023). The UCM holds that, particularly for adult
learners, explicit and reflective feedback can be particulary effective if they make use of
simple cues to form-function mappings. Such cues can help learners hold patterns in
memory through resonant connections between orthography, lexicon, and phonology in
ways that then promote initial entrenchment.
The classical competition model (MacWhinney, 1987, 1991) was centered around the
notion of the competition between various options or cues. The selection between the
competing cues is largely determined by the relative cue strength, which, in turn, is a
function of cue validity. Cue validity, encapsulating cue availability, cue reliability, and
conflict reliability, is operationally defined through the corpus counts of the cue. It is
hypothesized that availability is the primary determinant at the initial stage of the acqui sitional
 process. The learner initially decides which cues should be associated with which
meanings by using cue availability  a highly available cue will be more likely assigned
with high cue strength early in language acquisition. Therefore, L2 2 learner s attention can be effectively guided by valid cues from
the onset.
As with the extended version of the competition model, the UCM includes the analysis
of the detailed dynamic and evolving pattern of the learning process instead of focus ing
 only on the end state of language acquisition at specific times. Thus, timescales play
essential roles in the UCM when accounting for the effects of protective or supportive
factors in SLA study and the different instructional strategies needed to align with these
timescale variations (MacWhinney, 2015, 2018, 2021). Such extension in the UCM also
allows for the accommodations of highly complex, nonlinear, and stochastic language
phenomena, such as self-organization and bootstrapping, into the framework of the
model. At the core of the UCM are dynamic and interconnected competing processings
shaped by constraints that vary across timescales and linguistic levels (Caldwell-Harris
& MacWhinney, 2023).
A fundamental implication of the UCM is that competition can be shaped by learn ing
 and instructional strategies, such as feedback. Feedback may foster positive Page 5 22
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35 2 learning is conceptualized as the process of establish ing
 an additional set of form-function relationships in a target language. For example,
forms unmarked in L1 are usually transferred more strongly than marked forms (Eck man,
 1991  Major, 2001). A typical example is the difficulty of native Japanese speakers
to distinguish between English /r/ and /l/ in perception. MacWhinney (2008) noted that
the transfer of L1 2 1 2, and that such
transfer is counter-productive in the long run because it  embeds L1 2 lexicon  and results in  long-term difficulties in correcting entrenched
erroneous phonological transfer.   Therefore, to promote the acquisition of marked L2
phonemes, it is essential to optimize the input quality and frequency and provide cuefocused
 feedback.
In online settings, learners need to rely even more on high-quality feedback. Although
CALL provides unprecedented convenience in terms of learners  autonomy, self-effi cacy,
 and self-regulated incidental learning, it has inherent shortcomings, including the
absence of real-time interactions with teachers and the lack of social and physical sup port
 that a classroom environment can offer (Tsou et al., 2006  MacWhinney, 2015  Lys ter,
 2015). From the UCM perspective, a productive CALL environment must promptly
pinpoint errors and items to improve throughout various learning stages to strengthen
the valid cues, mappings, and resonances in the most effective manner. Also, L2 instruc tion
 should calibrate the level and depth of feedback to optimize the resonance and
internalization. This can be done using tailored task ladders for drill and self-contained
hints and explanations to foster the learner s metacognition and motivate engagement
(MacWhinney, 2015). In other words, CALL and feedback do not automatically bring
about effective learning. Whether and to what extent feedback in CALL may lead to
improved learning depends on whether the feedback has been optimally matched with
the learners  individual needs. Given that the empirical studies towards such quest are
rather scarce to date, the current study aims to fill the gap by investigating which feed back
 condition, basic or diagnostic, is more conducive to SLA in CALL.
Specifically, the objective of the current study is to examine how different types of
feedback may differently affect the development of Chinese phonological skills among
L2 learners of Chinese in an innovative CALL environment provided by the Pinyin Tutor
at TalkBank, an online human machine interactive L2 learning platform. The current
study aims to answer the following research questions.
1. To what extent will the repeated practice through the Pinyin Tutor promote positive
L2 2. To what extent will L2 learners benefit from the diagnostic or basic feedback pro vided
 by the Pinyin Tutor 
Implementation with the Pinyin Tutor
Programmed in Java and hosted at the TalkBank (MacWhinney & Fromm, 2022), Car negie
 Mellon Unversity, the Pinyin Tutor is a web-based Chinese Pinyin learning and
assessment platform suited for both self-regulated training and curriculum-oriented
classroom instructions. The Pinyin Tutor trains the learners to spell a word and provide Page 6 22 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35
corresponding feedback at either minimum or diagnostic levels. If the word is spelled
incorrectly three times, the tutor will present the correct spelling to the learner and then
proceed to the next item. When the learner finishes the dictation task, the tutor provides
the accuracy rate and asks if the learner would like to redo the incorrect items   Your
score is  x%. Would you like to review the items you missed   If the learner selects  yes,  
the tutor will extract the items spelled incorrectly and let the learner continue practic ing
 these problematic items. Otherwise, if the learner chooses  no,   the tutor will quit
by displaying  zai jian4  (goodbye). As learners practice on the Pinyin tutor, their per formances
 are recorded by the system. Authorized researchers and instructors can view
the log files, trace the learning progress, and identify specific learning problems. Log file
data include training-specific information such as user alias, score, time and length of
training, the round of practice, number of attempts in each item, and stimuli. The portfo lio
 is updated as soon as a learner completes a training session. Instructors can monitor
the performance of their students both individually and as a group to better understand
the difficulties posed in both the teaching and learning of Pinyin for individual students.
The Pinyin Tutor was designed to implement instructional strategies and methods
consistent with the UCM framework. Although the experiment reported in the current
study focuses on the impact of feedback on the L2 acquisition of Chinese phonologi cal
 knowledge, the tutor provides a variety of additional features aligned with the UCM,
such as the option of using familiar or novelty cues and tailored scheduling of practices.
In addition, the design and the underlying algorithm allow easy extensions to learning
other languages or other dialects of the same language. Second, the Pinyin Tutor has the
capacity to automatically populate and analyze the data generated throughout training,
particularly those pertinent to learning performance and progress, providing a thorough,
reliable, and rigorous reference for classroom instructors to optimize their teaching
plans and instructional methods. The tutor can generate learning behavior reports cov ering
 a large-scale corpus at various timescales, which is helpful for educational assess ment,
 modeling, and policy-making purposes at a macro level (Kowalski et  al., 2014).
Third, the feedback databases embedded in the Pinyin Tutor design were based on
rigorous data-mining analysis of the large-scale authentic corpus of L2 1 backgrounds after being benchmarked with the theoretical contrastive
phonological analysis between Chinese and other major languages. For completeness, all
the pronounceable syllables of Mandarin Chinese, close to four thousand in total, were
individually calibrated and included in the underlying database of the Pinyin Tutor. Fig ure 1
 is an illustration of the conceptual design of the main interface of the tutor.
A learner may register as an individual user for self-regulated learning. The instructor
for classroom instruction can create a group account or a link to each training session.
Upon navigation to the login page, students are required to enter their registered cre dentials
 to log in to the platform. The system double-checks the correctness of the IDs
to avoid misspellings. After logging in, the screen will remind the student to check the
audio volume. Descriptions and tutorials are available, informing the learners on how to
interact with the tutor and how to enter the Pinyin in the text box. For instance, users
are instructed to use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 5 for
the neutral tone. Also, spaces between syllables do not affect spelling accuracy. More
specific instructions and examples are provided in Zhang and MacWhinney (2023).Page 7 22
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35

The learner can press the  start  button to start a Pinyin dictation practice. An open
field for Pinyin entry, four navigating buttons, and one field for feedback are then pre sented
 on the web page for a Pinyin dictation task. After listening to a Chinese word, the
learner can enter its Pinyin transcription. Then, the learner has the alternative of click ing
 buttons to check the spelling or moving on to the next item. Specifically, the  Listen
to Target  button allows learners to listen to the target pronunciation repeatedly  the
 Listen to Your Attempt  button is grayed before the learner types in any answers in the
open field. When an error occurs, if the entry is regarded as a pronounceable item, this
button would be made available so the learner can listen to the word he/she had spelled.
The  Check  button informs the learner whether an item is correct or not. The  Next 
button allows learners to proceed to the next Pinyin dictation item.
In the basic feedback condition, the Pinyin Tutor only indicates if a Pinyin spelling
is correct or not. In the diagnostic feedback condition, detailed feedback is provided
when an error occurs. Examples of the diagnostic feedback are presented in Table  1.
The pool of diagnostic feedback messages was constructed based on a thorough error
analysis of the historical learners  corpus from contrastive analysis and universal
markedness perspective. The analysis examined the corpus for all the pronounceable
syllables of Chinese, their common error types, and their difficulties regarding the
feature system, segment inventory, and the distribution of errors. For instance, Eng lish
 has a set of affricates that sound like the Chinese retroflex affricates but are prone
to be confused by L2 1 in English. Furthermore, English
has both  r  and  l  in the initial position of a syllable, posing a challenge for English
Fig. 1 8 22 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35
background learners to listen and speak the Chinese syllable  r  . This is an example
of the negative transfer from the UCM point of view since the Chinese  r  and Eng lish
  r  are not identical, because the  r  in Chinese is pronounced with the tongue
curled up. Consequently, not hearing the differences between the Chinese  r  and  l  ,
the English L1 learners may associate the pronunciation of  r  with  l,   resulting in
a mismatch in the Pinyin practice. All such errors were analyzed and coded into the
diagnostic feedback messages in the Pinyin Tutor.
Test method and procedure
A series of dictation tasks were applied to train the ability to transcribe Chinese words in
Pinyin, with the degree of feedback being the control condition. To transcribe words or
sentences, one must decode the auditory input, map phonemes with their corresponding
graphemes, and encode them into text. The cognitive process of dictation is illustrated in
Fig.  2. Both problems in perception and trouble with the use of the spelling rules cause Table 1 4 4 Your attempt at the initial, n, is not correct

errors in Pinyin dictation. A proficient L2 learner of Chinese is expected not to be bound
by the sound-letter correspondence in his or her native language, and the learner should
have a linguistic awareness of phonological structure and the mastery of the phonoorthographical
 mappings in Chinese Pinyin. Thus, the learner s phonological perception
proficiency is predictable by the learner s orthographic transcription accuracy.
Two feedback conditions at different contrasting degrees were designed and embed ded
 in the Pinyin training offered by the Pinyin Tutor, one with only basic feedback
on whether a Pinyin transcription was correct or not, and the other with diagnostic
feedback regarding how and why the error was made. For example, errors caused by
incorrect transcription encoding could be addressed by verbal text feedback on Pinyin
spelling rules and descriptions. Detailed verbal feedback was also provided to correct
the mismatches due to L1 2 phonological problems, Pinyin spelling problems, or
both. In both conditions, the tutor allowed the participants to play the correct target
sound for comparison with the sound of the orthography they had generated. The tar get-attempt
 speech discrimination based on the  minimal pair  principle was adopted
in giving feedback. The minimal pair method has been widely used for speech therapy as
well as considerable speech perception or production training programs (Bradlow et al.,
1997  Gibbon et al., 1997). The contrast applied in the current experiment only repre sents
 a minimal pair when the student s production is incorrect in a single dimension.
The contrast is non-minimal if the production is wrong in more than one dimension.
To examine the role of feedback experimentally, 83 students enrolled in a regular
course in elementary Chinese at an American university participated in the test. The
learners received 2 weeks of conventional classroom instruction and learning focusing
on Pinyin knowledge before the start of the Pinyin Tutor training sessions in the fol lowing
 week after the Pinyin topic was covered. The participants were randomly allo cated
 to the two training conditions. Depending on whether the total number of letters
in the campus ID string was an odd or even number, the computer program assigned
the participant to either the diagnostic feedback or minimum feedback training group.
The participant stayed in the same treatment group throughout all the sessions so that
all participants received the same training stimuli except the types of feedback, which
are group specific. Researchers were only allowed to view the reports and analyze the
data with anonymized IDs. The number of subjects in the following analysis varied,
depending on the nature of the hypothesis. If the score in the posttest was more than 5
points lower than the pretest, data from that participant was dropped. As a result, the
test scores of two students were removed from the study by the screening. The partici pants
 attended elementary Chinese classes 4 hours per week throughout the semester
per credit requirement. None of them reported any hearing disability. Among them,
77 participated in at least one Pinyin training, 55 5 Pinyin ses sions
 of training, and 22 attended both the pre-and posttests and eight training sessions.
Data analysis mainly focused on the 55 students who participated in at least five Pinyin
training sessions. The distribution of participants  native languages is Korean (32.73%),
English (25.45%), Mandarin as a heritage language (16.36%), Cantonese as a heritage lan guage
 (18.18%), and others (7.27%).
The first phase of the study consisted of a pretest, a posttest, and eight training sessions.
The follow-up study in the second phase was a delayed posttest to examine performance Page 10 22 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35
retention. The pretest comprised 40 stimuli, including 17 monosyllabic words, 20 bisyl labic
 words, and three multisyllabic words. Among them, 16 were unknown words that
were not included in the textbook. Participants were given only one opportunity to lis ten
 to every word and were asked to transcribe them into Pinyin scripts. The eight train ing
 sessions spread from the 5 14th week. Pinyin practice was assigned weekly
or biweekly in the form of online homework. The first three training sessions were com prised
 of monosyllabic words. Stimuli in the remaining five sessions were bisyllabic and
multisyllabic words. In the eight training sessions, two-thirds of the stimuli was known
words (words from the textbook), and the remaining one-third was novel words (words
beyond the textbook). During each training session, participants were given three oppor tunities
 to transcribe the Chinese words into Pinyin in the first round. As the first round
concluded, participants were given additional opportunities in the subsequent rounds to
voluntarily practice the words that they had just misspelled until all the words were cor rectly
 spelled. The posttest was administered in the last instructional week. The stimuli
and format for the posttest were exactly the same as for the pretest. Together with the
posttest, an additional online survey about the participants  language background was
completed. The delayed posttest was carried out 13 weeks after the posttest. The stimuli
and format were the same as for the pretest and posttest. The timescales of the experi ment,
 spanning 28 weeks throughout the training sessions and tests, are demonstrated
in Fig. 3.
A Perl parser partitioned all the training stimuli and the test items into initials, finals,
and tones to conduct fine-tuned analysis. Java and Python are the primary programming
languages applied to analyze the learning profiles, such as the count of clickings on vari ous
 buttons, error rate, acquisition rate, and times spent on tasks. When calculating the
total times, only continuous activity was considered. When the Pinyin Tutor had been
inactive for a period of 3 minutes, this time was not counted into the total duration of
practice, allowing for circumstances such as the participant walking away in the middle
of Pinyin practice.
Results and analysis
The first research question concerns the overall learning-enhancing effect of the Pinyin
Tutor in benefiting the L2 acquisition of Pinyin skills under either of the two feedback
modes embedded in the Pinyin Tutor training. The question was quantitatively exam ined
 through the score improvement from pretest to posttest and from pretest to delayed
posttest as arranged through the training phases. With other conditions held equal and
random effects assumed normal, the significance of the Pinyin training effect is statisti cally
 equivalent to the score improvement being greater than zero at a reasonable confi dence
 level. For this purpose, paired t-tests were run to test the null hypothesis that the
Fig. 3 11 22
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35

mean scores of the pretest and posttest, at each aspect of Pinyin knowledge, are equal.
For these tests, each of the p-values is well below 0.001. More specifically, the p-values,
with sample size N   42, for the pretest posttest score comparison in word, syllable,
syllable without tone, initial, final, and tone are, respectively, 9.0095e-09, 8.0226e-13,
201034e-11, 1.2909e-6, 4.0786e-13, and 7.1865e-04. The corresponding effect sizes in
terms of Cohen d values are, respectively, 6.9725, 9.9695, 8.8833, 5.4535, 10.2009, and
3.4180. All these effect sizes are well above the benchmark values suggested by Plon sky
 and Oswald (2014) for an effect size to be significant in linguistic and educational
studies. Since the t-test is robust to normality, especially for moderate and large samples
such as N   40 (Rawlings et al., 2006), a simple z-score test can also be applied. Indeed,
the p-values generated by the z-score procedure tended to be less conservative in gen eral,
 where, for instance, the p-value of z-score test for the improvement in tone is about
0.0003, which is more than 50% smaller than that by the t-test. To sum up, there is suf ficiently
 significant evidence, based on the paired z-score test for approximation or t-test
for statistical rigor, that the Pinyin Tutor benefited the participants  learning in every
component of the Pinyin knowledge towards a higher proficiency in Chinese as an L2.
A similar conclusion can be drawn for the comparison between the pretest and the
delayed posttest, as all the p-values generated from the t-test are significant at a 95%
confidence level. Specifically, as shown in Table  2 and Fig.  4, the learners  scores in the
pretest and delayed posttest, with sample size N   21, saw a standardized increase of
21.36, 19.40, 17.10, 8.76, 13.01, and 11.52, respectively, in word, syllable, syllable with out
 tone, initial, final, and tone, where the standardized score was obtained by trans forming
 the raw number of the correct trials of the Pinyin stimuli in the test into the
corresponding value in one-hundredth scale assuming equal weights for each stimulus.
The corresponding p-values for these increments are, respectively, 6.0315e-9, 2.2855e-5,
1.1420e-5, 9.3113e-6, 1.6376e-6, and 1.7841e-2. The corresponding effect sizes in terms
of Cohen d values are, respectively, 9.2251, 5.1780, 5.3745, 5.5746, 6.3654, and 2.2526.
The difference between the two mean score increases, from pretest to posttest vs. pre test
 to delayed posttest, is very small, as shown in Fig.  4 2. More rigorously, the
minimum p-value from the formal t-tests for comparison of these two means at all six
components of Pinyin knowledge is above 0.30, thus confirming the improvements from
the pretest to the posttest and from the pretest to the delayed posttest are not statisti cally
 different. Such a finding tends to support the long-horizon retention of the Pinyin
knowledge learned through the Pinyin Tutor, as the time ellipsed between the posttest

 skills such as Pinyin listening and spelling to wane if they are not substantialized
from neurocognitive theory perspective (see Munro et al., 2012, for instance, for a more
detailed discussion on short memory of linguistic knowledge). In summary, the results
demonstrated that Pinyin Tutor has significantly enhanced the L2 learners  learning in
all aspects of Pinyin knowledge. The retention rate of the acquisition of Pinyin knowl edge
 through the Pinyin Tutor has been proven satisfactory and sustainable as tested
through both the posttest and the delayed posttest.
The second research question concerns the relative effectiveness of the two types
of feedback, namely, diagnostic vs. basic feedback, in enhancing the L2 learners 
acquisition of the various aspects of Pinyin skills. Such effects were tested through
the score differences between the pretest and posttest and those between the pretest
and the delayed posttest, as taken by the participants at different stages of practice.

higher than those for the basic group. Hence, diagnostic feedback, on average, gener ally
 helped the Pinyin learning through practice on the Pinyin Tutor for all the tested
Pinyin knowledge items. There is no evidence of a floor effect, as the pre-training pro ficiencies
 of the participants from the two groups did not exhibit statistical difference
with p-value   0.70 for the F-test for comparison of means of their pretest scores. The
advantage of diagnostic feedback in learning enhancement is particularly significant
at the tone level of Pinyin knowledge since the average score increment between prepost
 tests for the diagnostic feedback group of learners is 26.97, as opposed to 9.48
for the basic feedback group, which corresponds to a two-tailed p -value of 0.001 from
one-way ANOVA.
Given that the classical comparison of means in ANOVA assumes relatively stricter
conditions on the samples, different kinds of p -values were calculated and presented
in Fig.  5 to mitigate the potential biasedness. Specifically, the Fisher permutation test
and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were chosen for comparison in consideration of their
lower sensitivity to normality and sample size. As demonstrated, the three kinds of
p-values for testing the significance of the advantage of diagnostic feedback pro duced
 consistent results. However, the p -values from the classical ANOVA t -test are
more significant than those from the other two. The results showed that the learn ing-enhancing
 effect of diagnostic feedback is more decisively higher than basic feed back
 in the levels of word, syllable, and tone, where, for instance, the p -values for
the Fisher permutation test with 1000 iterations, as shown by Fig.  6, are 0.001, 0.054,
and 0.057, respectively, all statistically significant at a 90% level of confidence. On
the other hand, the advantage of diagnostic feedback over basic feedback in terms of
pre-post test score improvement is less decisive in the levels of syllable without tone,
initial, and final, where, for instance, the p -values from the ANOVA t -test are, respec tively,
 0.260, 0.322, and 0.204. Similar results are shown from the other two kinds of
Fig. 5 Significance of pretest posttest improvements for the two feedback conditions (N   23 19 for diagnostic)Page 14 22 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35
p-value tests. Although the sample size is only moderate, the results are robust as
consistent p-values have been observed across different tests with potential bias taken
into account.
As the p-value tests provided mixed results regarding the statistical significance of the
advantage of diagnostic feedback over basic feedback when conducted individually on
the itemized Pinyin knowledge learning, a multivariate analysis of variances (MANOVA)
is desired for a more general conclusion to be made. Here, the Hotelling t-squared test
is chosen for the group-wise comparison of the means of the score improvements in the
two feedback modes in Pinyin Tutor training. The normality of the data was confirmed
by a formal multivariate normality test, with the Shapiro Wilk statistics and the cor responding
 p-values being 0.9939 0.3982 0.9797 0.0536 for pretest to delayed posttest improvement. In addition, the assump tion
 of the equality of covariance matrices was met with the p-values greater than 0.10
for the Box  M tests for both the pretest-posttest and the pretest-delayed posttest com parisons
 (Huberty, 2005). As shown in Table  4, the Hotelling p-value of 0.5951 is not
significant when testing the combined advantageous effect of diagnostic feedback in the
syllable without tone, initial and final levels of Pinyin knowledge. However, the p-value
Fig. 6 Fisher permutation test of pretest posttest improvements between diagnostic and basic feedback
groups (N   23 19 for diagnostic)Page 15 22
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35 0.0191 is significant enough when testing the combined advantageous effect of diag nostic
 feedback in the word, syllable, and tone levels of Pinyin knowledge. Overall, the
Hotelling p-value of 0.0512 is significant, at about 95% confidence level, when testing the
combined advantageous effect of diagnostic feedback over basic feedback in the score
improvement in all the six components of Pinyin knowledge considered altogether.
To summarize, the advantageous effects of diagnostic feedback over basic feedback in
the Pinyin training for score improvement from the pretest to the posttest varied across
different components of Pinyin knowledge. Notwithstanding, when taking all aspects of
Pinyin knowledge, diagnostic feedback s overall advantageous effect was shown as sig nificant
 at a confidence level of around 95%, as confirmed by an analysis of Hotelling
statistics in a MANOVA.
The results for the learners  performance difference between the pretest and delayed
posttest under two training modes of feedback, with sample size N   13 8 for the diagnostic feedback group, were demonstrated in
Table  5. In consistency with the results of the pre-posttests comparison, the score
improvement under the diagnostic feedback condition outperformed that under the
basic feedback condition for all the components of Pinyin knowledge items, although
not all the differences are significant enough. Specifically, the mean score improvement
from the pretest to the delayed posttest in the syllable level of Pinyin was 41.85 under
diagnostic feedback mode, compared to 33.86 under basic feedback mode, representing
a difference of 23.6%. This corresponds to a two-sided p-value of 0.162 for ANOVA, a
p-value of 0.296 1000 iterations, as shown in Fig.  7,
and a p-value of 0.331 for the rank-sum test, which are not significant at a confidence
level of 90%. However, the mean score improvement in syllable without tone was 45.20 28.95 under basic feedback mode, which corre sponds

test, and a p-value of 0.025 for the rank-sum test, each of which is significant at a confi dence
 level of 95%. The comparative barplots of the three kinds of p-values for assessing
to what extent diagnostic feedback had outperformed basic feedback in acquiring each
component of Pinyin knowledge are presented in Fig.  8. The learning-enhancing effect
of diagnostic feedback is significantly higher than that of basic feedback in the syllable
without tone, initial, and final levels of Pinyin knowledge while still marginally higher in
the other three aspects of Pinyin knowledge, namely, word, syllable, and tone.
Similarly, the Hotelling t -squared test was conducted for the group-wise comparison of
the means of the score improvement to assess the overall advantage of diagnostic feedback
over basic feedback in Pinyin training. As shown in Table  6, the Hotelling p -value is not sig nificant
 for the combined advantageous effect of diagnostic feedback in word, syllable, and
tone levels of Pinyin knowledge. Nevertheless, the Hotelling p-value of 0.0138 99% confidence level when testing the combined advantageous effect of diagnos tic
 feedback in the syllable without tone, initial, and final levels of Pinyin knowledge. The
overall Hotelling p -value of 0.0874 90% confidence level when testing
the combined advantageous effect of diagnostic feedback in all the components of Pinyin
knowledge under consideration.

To summarize, when taking all aspects of Pinyin knowledge as a whole, the overall com bined
 advantageous effect of diagnostic feedback is significant at a confidence level of 90%,
despite that such advantageous effects showed varied magnitudes across different com ponents
 of Pinyin knowledge. In consolidation of the results for the score improvement
between pre-posttests and that between pre- and delayed posttests, the overall learning
enhancing effect of diagnostic feedback is demonstrated as stronger than that of basic feed back
 in Pinyin learning through the Pinyin Tutor. Nevertheless, caution should be made to
generalize the nuanced component-specific pattern in consideration of the high dimension ality
 of the experiment and relatively small sample size, which may have resulted in a loss of
statistical power. Potential noise factors could also have exerted a confounding influence on
the overall empirical significance of the test.

Discussion
The extent to which diagnostic feedback proved more effective than basic feedback
varied across different aspects of Pinyin and across posttest vs. delayed posttest. As
elaborated in the  Results and analysis  section, diagnostic feedback demonstrated its
strongest advantage over basic feedback for the levels of the word, syllable, and tone, but
it had a lesser effect for syllable without tone, initial, and final. One possible explanation
of such a discrepancy is that tone perception involves a smaller number of contrasts than
segmental perception. The difficulty caused by Pinyin initials and finals is more delicate
and multidimensional. There are many ways in which negative L1 transfers can arise. For
example, it may take years of exposure to learn the correct perception and articulation of
Chinese /y/ and /ü/ by some L2 learners of Chinese, in a similar challenge for a speaker
of Japanese to learn English /r/ and /l/ (MacWhinney, 2015  Ingvalson et al., 2012).
The fact that these advantages for diagnostic feedback did not carry over to the delayed
posttest could be related to the fact that only the most motivated students continued
with the delayed posttest. Also, the average score of those delayed posttest participants
in the pretest was about 9 points higher, on average, for all Pinyin knowledge assessed.
Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the learners who participated in the delayed post test
 had higher prior knowledge of Pinyin overall and were more highly motivated to
Pinyin learning. The already relatively higher proficiency in Pinyin tone made it harder
for them to increase further their test scores in this respect through repeated Pinyin
training with diagnostic feedback. However, diagnostic feedback did provide them with
more advantages to maneuver the more challenging part of Pinyin, such as some subtle
initials, finals, and their delicate pronounceable combinations.
One noteworthy remark is that the correlations between the learners  score improve ment
 and the number of times the sound contrast was listened to are insignificant.
For instance, such correlation calculated for the word dimension improvement in the
diagnostic group from pretest to posttest is only  0.039 with a p-value of 0.861. One
explanation of why repeated sound contrast listening did not seem to contribute to the
dictation skill improvement comes from the results of the error analysis, which showed
that 6% of the errors with initials and more than 10% of the errors with finals were pro duced
 due to orthographic transfer from English or other L s. Some pronounceable
sounds in Pinyin may not have a clear mapping in the corresponding L1 phonological
categories. The current feedback designed for phonological errors did not consider the
misconceptions of L1 orthographic transfer. Also, the sound comparison might have
presented too many contrasting features simultaneously, so the learner s working mem ory
 was overloaded (Clark et al., 2006). These said, more finely tuned experiments are
needed towards a more definite understanding of the concerned correlations, as there
could be many reasons for replaying the contrasts or not, including possibly pure techni cal
 reasons.
The feedback in the current study primarily focused on learning the Pinyin knowledge
of the Chinese language. However, the pedagogical benefit of such a feedback-embedded
CALL environment is extendable to a broad spectrum of SLA in general. Given other
equal conditions, whether an educational platform can provide intelligent feedback is
emblematic of whether individual variabilities have been finely taken care of throughout
the learning process, which is essential to a successful SLA (MacWhinney, 2021  Pawlak, Page 19 22
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35 2022). In addition, there has been tremendous development in automated writing assess ment.
 Integrating feedback and CALL has helped foster self-efficacy and self-regulated
learning from the learner s perspective and decreased the cost and time spent in assess ment
 from the educator s perspective. For instance, Zhang and Wu (2021) demonstrated
that Chinese learners  speaking proficiency could be effectively scored by lexical rich ness
 indices profiled by the learner s speech discourse. The lexical richness measures D,
LogTTR, and RootTTR have been shown as particularly effective in assessing the level
of nativeness of the L2 learners  speech production of Chinese. Given the fallibility and
surging cost of human raters, the automated feedback method employed in the current
study should be particularly useful for L2 educators who strive for a reliable automated
rating tool based on the speech corpus of the learners. Facilitated primarily by the everincreasing
 machine learning and deep learning technologies, automated assessment has
already been extensively adopted for the English language (Deane, 2013). Incorporating
such automated language assessment with intelligent diagnostic feedback is advisable to
continuously and dynamically foster language teaching and learning more effectively.
Conclusion
Language learning is complex. Such complexity is epitomized in the UCM framework
by the emergent nature of language acquisition, the competition between various forms
or patterns at different timeframes, and the multidimensionalness of the structures and
processes involved. As an implication, the fundamental principle of language instruction
should be to optimally foster various protective factors while overcoming or harnessing
various risk factors at each stage of language development, where the major risk fac tors,
 in the context of L2 learning, include entrenchment, misconnection, and negative
transfer. While there are many possible ways to implement these principles, feedback
has been shown to be one of the most critical learning and teaching strategies for L2
acquisition, and its importance is further emphasized in a technology-assisted language
learning environment, where, devoid of face-to-face coaching that a classroom-instruc tion
 may offer, the errors in learning are prone to be entrenched. The current study
undertakes to examine how feedback in general, and the quality of feedback in terms of
whether learners  mistakes are timely and delicately diagnosed, may facilitate the acqui sition
 of Chinese Pinyin knowledge among the L2 learner of Chinese under an innova tive
 CALL environment.
The findings showed that repeated training with feedback significantly enhanced
Pinyin learning as measured by the score improvements between the tests arranged
before and after the training sessions. Statistically significant improvement was demon strated
 in each component of Pinyin skills being trained and tested, namely, word, syl lable,
 syllable without tone, initial, final, and tone. High retention of Pinyin knowledge
acquired through the Pinyin Tutor training was confirmed by the current study as a
delayed posttest had demonstrated largely equivalent statistical significance in terms of
accuracy rate in the Pinyin task trials by the participants, where the delayed posttest was
conducted 3  months after the posttest. In juxtaposition with the findings reported by
Zhang and MacWhinney (2023), the current study provides further evidence of the ped agogical
 effectiveness of the Pinyin Tutor, where the technology was finely embedded Page 20 22 Zhang and MacWhinney  Language Testing in Asia           (2023) 13 35
with psycholinguistic theories as well as corpus-based research on the speech produc tion
 of L2 learners.
As confirmed by the current study, the content of feedback, both in breadth and depth,
does significantly impact the learning performance of the CALL. Specifically, diagnostic
feedback led to greatere imporvement than basic feedback for the word, syllable, and
tone aspects of Pinyin knowledge. The depth of feedback and how such diagnostics are
integrated with the Pinyin Tutor can be further improved to more fully accommodate
the multifaceted complexity of L2 learning. For example, the contrastive sound analy sis
 may overlook the diversity and complexity of the languages that the L2 learner of
Chinese may grow up with  the parents could speak different languages in the house hold,
 the neighborhood could be a melting pot of dialects, the learner could be multi lingual
 without a clearcut L1 identity, and all such scenarios are becoming increasingly
less uncommon with the fast-paced societal changes. Though challenging, the task of
differentiating the wide spectrum of L1 and providing scenario-fitted feedback should
be a promising direction for upgrading the Pinyin Tutor. Another aspect hindering the
best performance of the current Pinyin Tutor is that many contrasting features are pre sented
 simultaneously and repeated uniformly to the learner regardless of the number
of attempts the learner has made on the task item. An improvement is desirable to take
into consideration the influence of working memory capacity (Goo, 2012) to avoid overfeedback
 at a particular stage of learning.
For the hardware and software aspect of the Pinyin Tutor, there are abundant possibili ties
 to improve further. More gamification and social interaction features could be added
to the system to meet the life and learning styles of the young generations of language
learners. So far, the data analysis functions of the Pinyin Tutor are primarily descriptive
and static. Although a class-wise summary or an overview of a learner s performance
is available, individual learners  characteristics are not sufficiently analyzed or utilized.
More sophisticated computing schemes from machine learning and artificial intelligence
may play a higher facilitating role in the algorithm design, including estimating the
learners  learning curve and predicting their learning performance and error patterns
more proactively and dynamically.
