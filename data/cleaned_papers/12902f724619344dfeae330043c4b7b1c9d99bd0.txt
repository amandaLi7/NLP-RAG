Abstract
With NLP research now quickly being transferred
 into real-world applications, it is important
 to be aware of and think through the consequences
 of our scientific investigation. Such
ethical considerations are important in both authoring
 and reviewing. This tutorial will equip
participants with basic guidelines for thinking
deeply about ethical issues and review common
considerations that recur in NLP research. The
methodology is interactive and participatory,
including case studies and working in groups.
Importantly, the participants will be co-building
the tutorial outcomes and will be working to
create further tutorial materials to share as public
 outcomes.
1 2021, the Association for Computational
Linguistics  executive committee appointed an
Ethics Committee to investigate long-term ethical
issues of the community s research and legislate
any policy and workflow changes to the authoring,
reviewing and other processes. The committee surveyed
 the constituency s opinions, wants and needs,
finding that the majority of respondents felt that
clear guidelines on acceptable practices regarding
authoring and reviewing were needed. Specifically,
in response to the question  What do you think are
the most urgent tasks for the global *CL ethics committee  ,
 50% of respondents highlighted the need
for more resources and discussion forums to raise
awareness in the community about ethical issues in
research and to clarify ethical review policies, 36%
specifically mentioned the importance of creating
dedicated training materials for authors and reviewers,
 and 26% encouraged more outreach initiatives
to facilitate discussion about ethical research in the
community.
This tutorial proposal thus follows from the mandate
 from the survey, such that more interactive
opportunities exist to best communicate and trainour membership on ethical guidelines and research
practices.
The tutorial also draws on related, successful
past tutorials on NLP reviewing and socially responsible
 NLP (  100 participants) (Cohen et al.,
2021  Tsvetkov et al., 2018), where some of the
proposed tutorial instructors have been involved.
We propose a hybrid tutorial to best allow equitable
 access to the topic of this tutorial, especially
 to familiarize new community members and
those who cannot afford access to attend physically.
We plan to have dedicated presenters that can coordinate
 activities for the expected online participants.
 We may plan to use specific e-resources that
can help facilitate virtual group discussions (e.g.,
Padlet, PollEverywhere, Google Docs, Slack).
We intend to make the tutorial presentation materials
 publicly available, in alignment with the stated
goals of the tutorials. As an example, annotated presentation
 slides (with presenter notes) will be made
available, such that tutorial participants can bring
exercises of different lengths into classroom settings
 for research groups as well as undergraduate
and graduate classes. We will organize a separate
website via a Github repository1(to be owned by
the ACL) to centralize our tutorial resources for
long-term and public access.
However, due to the sensitive and formative nature
 of the small-group discussions, we will not
record the small-group discussions so that participants
 can speak freely and off-the-record. The
plenary, lecture-styled sessions (Sessions 1 7)
may be recorded live, or pre-recorded offline.
This proposal tutorial aligns with the theme track
 Reality Check of ACL 2023. Most of the challenges
 addressed by the theme track, including
out-of-domain generalization, adversarial attacks,
spurious patterns (both linguistic and social), insensitivity
 to basic linguistic perturbations such as

negation, sensitivity to perturbations that should
not matter (e.g., order and wording of prompts),
are deeply related to ethical considerations of NLP
research. In particular, proper discussion of risks
(e.g., failure modes and vulnerabilities to adversarial
 attacks) and limitations (the scope of your
claims, not overselling) is an integral to the theme
and also for ethics authoring and reviewing. Finally,
 the theme track raises the question  what is
an improvement in the real-world  , which is directly
 related to the social impact issues addressed
by ethics reviewing.
2 1/2 day, Introductory
Expected Attendees   100
Audience  Authors and reviewers, interested
parties
Desired Location  Preferably ACL (Toronto,

Prerequisites   Introductory background in natural
language processing and deep learning, including
a basic familiarity of commonly-used approaches
to text classification and generation, and standard
NLP tasks. Fluent command of English.
Ethical consideration overarch our duties as researchers
 and scientists. As members of our community,
 and representatives of our works to both
the general public and practitioners, we need to
consider the ramifications of our work. The need
for a better understanding of ethics is reflected in
both authoring and reviewing, key functions of our
community s peer review process.
Unintended and harmful ethical lapses and consequences
 can be largely avoided through contin-uing communication. Rather than assume that research
 is purely an intellectual pursuit, our tutorial
invites participants to consider ethics as an integral
component of the holistic framework of impactful
 research work. Table 1 presents our proposed
tutorial s outline. Our aim is to provide handson
 experience with ethical issues through a smallgroup
 activity, both at the physical conference and
in breakout rooms for online participants.
Ethics requires healthy debate and deep thought,
and for these reasons, our structure incorporates a
Socratic exercise, where participants spend a large
part of the session discussing a concrete case of
problematic research. A Community of Inquiry2
approach will be taken such that participants engage
 in role-playing and discussing about ethical
issues through reading 1 2 problematic hypothetical
 research abstracts from a curated set (  2.1).
Using Socratic-style questioning, presenters guide
the participants to engender discussion and realise
ethical issues in the works.
Importantly, the participants will be co-building
the tutorial outcomes and will be working to create
further tutorial materials to share as public outcomes
 of the exercises. For many issues in ethics,
the evolving discussion creates more value than the
actual conclusions. This is why we propose such a
dialectic approach.
To encapsulate the exercise, the presenters will
first introduce the key ways that ethics impacts authoring
 and reviewing (Segment 1), summarise the
group discussions  key points (Segment 6) and conclude
 with pointers to references and other training
materials (Segment 7), including best practices for
authoring ethical consideration sections (Benotti
and Blackburn, 2022) and reviewing.
Due to the necessary interactivity of the session,
we plan to limit the registrations for the tutorial to
100. This is to cater to having approximately a 25 1
ratio for presenters to participants. A larger volume
 than this jeopardizes the necessary interactive
nature of the tutorial, which requires input from all
participants.
2.1 Case studies
In the interactive portion of the tutorial, we will
discuss research abstracts and will facilitate group
discussions guided by critical questions about the
proposed technology. Participants will be encour https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Community_of_inquiry aged to discuss the following questions 
 Ethics of the research question  Would answering
 this research question advance science
 without violating social contracts  What
are potentials for misuse 
 Social impact of the proposed technology and
its potential dual use  Who could benefit from
such a technology  Who can be harmed by
such a technology  Could sharing data and
models have major effects on people s lives 
 Privacy  Who owns the data  Understanding
 the differences between published versus
publicized data, understanding the concept of
user consent, and thinking about implicit assumptions
 of users on how their data will be
used.
 Bias in data  What are possible artifacts in
data, given population-specific distributions 
How representative is this data to address the
target task 
 Social bias and unfairness in models  Is there
sufficient control for confounding variables
and corner cases  Does the system optimize
for the  right  objective  Could the system
amplify data bias 
 Is the proposed evaluation sufficient  Is there
a utility-based evaluation beyond accuracy 
e.g., measurements of false positive and false
negative rates as measurements of fairness 
What is  the cost  of misclassification and
fault (in)tolerance 
Our case studies will be hypothetical  i.e., we
will not use abstracts from existing studies but
will create abstracts that will allow us to highlight
 potential ethical issues covering multiple, diverse
 ethics-related topics, including human subjects
 research and institutional review board (IRB)
approval, bias and fairness, privacy, misinformation,
 toxicity/content moderation, energy considerations/green
 AI. We will develop several representative
 case studies for participants to choose from 
we show an example below that illustrates multiple
problematic aspects within one study, which was
adapted from an actual problematic recent study.
The following abstract introduces an unethical
research question, a demographically biased data
set, a data collection procedure that violates userprivacy, a problematic evaluation procedure, and
claims/potential applications that can lead to significant
 harms to individuals.
Abstract  Faces contain more information about sexual orientation
 than can be perceived by the human brain. We used
deep neural networks to extract features from over 35 thousand
 facial images. Given a single facial image, a classifier
could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual
men in 80% of cases, and in 70% of cases for women.
Accuracy increased to 90% and 80%, respectively, given
five facial images per person. Facial features employed
by the classifier included both fixed (e.g., nose shape) and
transient facial features (e.g., grooming style). Consistent
with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation,
gay men and women tended to have gender-atypical facial
morphology, expression, and grooming styles. Prediction
models aimed at gender alone detected with 55% and 53%
accuracy for gay males and gay females, respectively. Such
findings advance our understanding of the origins of sexual
 orientation and the limits of human perception. Given
that organizations are using computer vision algorithms to
detect people s intimate traits, our findings expose a threat
to the privacy and safety of gay men and women.
2.2 Readings
We will cover a diversity of primary research on
ethics, sourced beyond the presenters  own works,
in the plenary sessions of the tutorial. Also, due to
the abbreviated length of the 1/2-day format, our
tutorial will cross reference sources from the list,
rather than specifically require participants to do
readings before the tutorial.
A full reading list of over 200 works has been
cross-compiled by the full ACL Ethics Committee,
 sourced from university courses on NLP Ethics
and related topics. The list available on Github3.
The list can be updated by pull requests and is
sortable by both topic and publication type. Topics
and readings include the following among others

4 Diversity considerations
The instructors of this tutorial are affiliated in different
 geographic regions. Luciana Benotti is inLatin America, KÃ¤ren Fort in Europe, Min-Yen
Kan in Asia and Yulia Tsvetkov in North America.
 Three of them identify with the female gender
and one with the male gender. All of them are
part of the ACL Ethics committee. We will promote
 this tutorial to all the ACL members but in
particular to affinity groups such as Masakane, LatinX,
 North Africans, disabled in AI, indigenous
in AI, Khipu and similar groups with the help of
EquiCL. EquiCL is the only Big Interest Group in
the ACL, its scope is equity and diversity and its
current officers are Marine Carpuat (chair), Aline
Villavicencio (secretary), Zeerak Waseem (communication
 with workshops and affinity groups). We
think it is crucial to reach a diverse audience for
this tutorial.
5 Ethical considerations
We are well aware that we do not compose a perfectly
 diverse committee and commit to pay close
attention to ensure all participants  points of views
are faithfully acknowledged.
We decided to use synthetic case studies in the
form of abstracts, rather than real and complete
articles, in order to preserve the anonymity of the
authors, to refrain from personal criticism, and to
allow the participants to focus more on the discussion
 than on the reading. We will create a variety of
abstracts, with different forms, exemplifying different
 ethical issues, however, they will not cover all
the possible ethical issues in the domain. Finally,
the synthetic case studies will be clearly identified
as such.
