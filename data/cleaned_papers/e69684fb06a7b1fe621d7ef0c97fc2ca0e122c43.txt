This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment.

Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) enable system
builders today to create competent NLP systems
 through prompting, where they only need
to describe the task in natural language and
provide a few examples. However, in other
ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional
 special-purpose NLP models  they require
 extensive computational resources for
deployment and can be gated behind APIs.
In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model , a
general-purpose method that takes a natural
language task description like the prompts provided
 to LLMs, and uses it to train a specialpurpose
 model that is conducive to deployment.
 This is done through a multi-step process
 of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained
 models, dataset generation using LLMs,
and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved
and generated datasets. Over three tasks,
we demonstrate that given the same few-shot
prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models
 that outperform the results of a strong LLM,
gpt-3.5-turbo , by an average of 20% while
being up to 700 times smaller. We also show
that this data can be used to obtain reliable
performance estimates of model performance,
enabling model developers to assess model reliability
 before deployment. Prompt2Model

1 Introduction
Traditionally, building an NLP model from scratch
has been a substantial undertaking. An NLP practitioner
 seeking to solve a new problem would need
to define their task scope, find or create data that
specifies the intended system behavior, choose a
suitable model architecture, train the model, assess
its performance through evaluation, and then deploy
 it for real-world usage (Paleyes et al., 2022).

 a small yet accurate model from a prompt.
LLMs like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020  Liu
et al., 2023b) offer a lighter-weight paradigm
for NLP system construction through  prompting 
 (Reynolds and McDonell, 2021). Practitioners
can now write a prompt specifying the intended
system behavior (optionally with a few demonstrations),
 and ask an LLM to generate a desired output
 via text completion. This makes it possible
to prototype NLP systems rapidly for a variety of
applications without writing a single line of code
(Floridi and Chiriatti, 2020).
However, there is still a gap between proofof-concept
 prototyping   showing LLMs can be
prompted for a particular task   and practical deployment.
 Prompting LLMs can be expensive as
they require either a significant amount of computing
 or access to commercial APIs, and their reliance
 on the input prompt quality makes them unstable
 compared to trained models (Min et al., 2022 
Bubeck et al., 2023). Because practitioners usually
do not have enough annotated validation data to
measure their system performance, it is also more
challenging for them to debug their systems before
 deployment (Jiang et al., 2022). Additionally,arXiv 2308.12261v1  [cs.CL]  23 Aug 2023LLM-prompted systems pose usability challenges.
Practitioners have expressed concerns about the
high serving cost and slow prediction time associated
 with using LLMs (Park et al., 2022), and
those working in high-stakes domains cannot rely
on commercial LLM APIs due to privacy concerns.
For instance, sharing user data with LLM service
providers is illegal for many applications in the
US (Sezgin et al., 2022).
In this work, we present Prompt2Model , a
system that retains the ability to specify system
behavior in a light-weight way through prompting,
 while still resulting in a deployable specialpurpose
 model , maintaining all the advantages
thereof. Prompt2Model is designed as an automated
 pipeline that extracts essential task information
 from users  prompts and then automatically
collects and synthesizes task-specific knowledge
through three channels 
 Dataset retrieval   Whenever possible, we collect
 training data by retrieving task-relevant
annotated data (Färber and Leisinger, 2021 
Viswanathan et al., 2023).
 Dataset generation   We distill knowledge from
an LLM ( teacher model ) by employing it to
generate a pseudo-labeled dataset. Prior work
has demonstrated that such a dataset can be used
to train a smaller  student  model to emulate
the behavior of the teacher model (Wang et al.,
2021a  He et al., 2023  Gudibande et al., 2023).
 Model retrieval   Based on the prompt, we identify
 a pretrained language model whose parametric
 knowledge is appropriate for the user s intent.
This chosen model serves as the student model
and is further fine-tuned and evaluated using the
generated and retrieved data.
Prompt2Model is designed to support different
 instantiations of each of these components.
We provide a reference implementation where
we demonstrate its utility with a gpt-3.5-turbo based
 dataset generator, a dataset retriever based
on DataFinder (Viswanathan et al., 2023), and
a model retriever using BM25. We evaluate on
three tasks covering both traditional NLP benchmarks
 and novel applications and find that, empirically,
 Prompt2Model sometimes produces small
models that outperform gpt-3.5-turbo when using
 the same prompt as input. On 2 of these 3
tasks, we observe  20 point improvements over the
gpt-3.5-turbo baseline, despite the final model
produced by Prompt2Model being up to 700 timessmaller. We also find that we can generate effective
evaluation datasets  performance improvements
on these synthetic clones of real benchmarks also
hold on their real counterparts. We believe that
Prompt2Model can serve the following purposes
for the community 
1.A tool for quickly building small and competent
 NLP systems  Prompt2Model can be
directly used to produce task-specific models
that outperform LLMs in a few hours without
any manual data annotation or architecture design.
 The method bridges the gap between the
proof-of-concept LLM prototyping and the practical
 deployment of the model.
2.A testbed for end-to-end, prompt-based
model training   Given Prompt2Model  s extensible
 design, it can offer a platform for exploring
 new techniques in model distillation,
dataset generation, synthetic evaluation, dataset
retrieval, and model retrieval. Our platform
allows studying these components using extrinsic
 downstream metrics, enabling empirical
progress on these research areas.
2 Prompt2Model Framework
Our system, Prompt2Model , provides a platform
to automate the components of a machine learning
pipeline  data collection, model training, evaluation,
 and deployment. We illustrate our automated
pipeline in Figure 2. At the core is our automatic
data collection system, which leverages dataset retrieval
 and LLM-based dataset generation to obtain
labeled data relevant to the user s needs. We then
retrieve pretrained models which we finetune on
the training splits of the collected datasets. Finally,
we evaluate our trained models on the test splits of
the same datasets and optionally create a web UI
that can be used to interact with the model.
Our general-purpose method is designed to be
modular and extensible  each component can be implemented
 differently or disabled by a practitioner.
We give an overview of our framework, then in section
 3 we describe our reference implementation.
Prompt Parser As the primary input to our system,
 users provide prompts similar to those used
for LLMs. These prompts comprise an instruction
and, optionally, a few demonstrations of the anticipated
 behavior. While this open-ended interface
is convenient for users, end-to-end ML pipelines
may benefit from a Prompt Parser that processes
this input, such as segmenting the prompt into anThe

instruction and individual demonstrations or translating
 instructions into English.
Dataset Retriever Given a prompt, we first try to
discover existing manually-annotated data that can
support a user s task description. There are several
design decisions for the Dataset Retriever  
1. What datasets to search against 
2. How to index datasets for search 
3.Which dataset columns are needed for the user s
task, and which columns should be ignored 
Prior works by Färber and Leisinger (2021) and
Viswanathan et al. (2023) introduced systems for
dataset search. We use the latter, called DataFinder ,
in our implementation, as described in  3.2.
Dataset Generator Not all conceivable tasks
have any existing annotated data, and many tasks
are only somewhat relevant to an existing dataset.
To support a wide range of tasks, we introduce a
Dataset Generator to produce synthetic training
data as per the user-specific requirements parsed by
thePrompt Parser . This component presents challenges
 related to cost efficiency, generation speed,
example diversity, and quality control. We discuss
our suggested solution to these challenges in  3.3.
Model Retriever Besides training data, we must
identify an appropriate model to finetune. We cast
this as a retrieval problem, where each model is represented
 by user-generated descriptions and metadata
 such as popularity or tasks supported. The
reference implementation of our Model Retriever ,
described in  3.4, searches against pretrained models
 on Hugging Face (Wolf et al., 2020), but thiscould instead cover other model repositories such
as Model Zoo (Koh, 2020).
Training Given retrieved and generated datasets
and a pretrained model, we use a Model Trainer
to finetune the model on a subset of the data. We
currently train models by treating all tasks as textto-text
 generation (Raffel et al., 2020), as described
in  3.5, but emphasize that this component can be
extended in the future to support new approaches.
Evaluation After training models on a portion of
the retrieved and generated datasets, we give the
remaining data to an Model Evaluator module. We
aim to support a variety of tasks, and selecting the
correct task-specific metrics for an arbitrary task
is a difficult problem. We describe our suggested
strategies for task-agnostic evaluation in  3.6.
Web App Creation To enable developers to expose
 a model to collaborators or users, we include
an optional component called the Demo Creator
to create a graphical interface to interact with the
model. We briefly describe our implementation of
this component in  3.7.
3 Reference Implementation
Prompt2Model is designed modularly to support
customization of each component in our framework
(described in  2), but we have provided a reference
implementation to enable immediate adoption.
3.1 Prompt Parser
We parse the prompt into instruction and
demonstrations fields (shown in Figure 2), wherethe instruction represents the primary task or objective
 and the demonstrations exemplify the desired
behavior. To achieve this, we utilize an LLM with
in-context learning to segment user prompts, employing
 the OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 in our
experiments. If the instruction provided is identified
 to be in a language other than English, we
translate it to English using the DeepL API.2
3.2 Dataset Retriever
To retrieve datasets for a prompt, we adapt the
DataFinder system introduced by Viswanathan
et al. (2023). By extracting user-generated
dataset descriptions for each dataset in Hugging
Face Datasets (Lhoest et al., 2021), we utilize
DataFinder s trained bi-encoder retriever to rank
the most relevant datasets. Once a relevant dataset
is identified, the next step is to determine which
columns of the dataset correspond to the input and
the desired output specified by the user. As automatically
 inducing the correct schema for any
dataset can be challenging, we adopt a human-inthe-loop
 approach. We present the top- kdatasets,
where k  25 by default, to the user and allow
them to either select the most relevant dataset or to
state that none are a good fit for their task. We then
ask the user to identify the appropriate columns for
input and output from the dataset s schema.
3.3 Dataset Generator
We carefully engineered our dataset generator to
enable speed-optimized generation at a low-cost
while creating diverse and high-quality examples.
Our strategy comprises the following components 
High-Diversity Few-Shot Prompting We use
automated prompt engineering to generate a diverse
dataset. We augment the user-provided demonstration
 examples with a random sample of previously
generated examples to promote diversity and avoid
generating duplicate examples. Without this strategy,
 120 out of 200 generated QA examples were
duplicates  with it, only 25 were duplicates.
Temperature Annealing We adjust the sampling
temperature from low (favoring deterministic outputs)
 to high (encouraging diverse exploration) proportionally
 to the number of examples already generated.
 This modulation helps preserve output quality
 while gradually encouraging diversity.
2https //www.deepl.com/en/docs-apiSelf-Consistency Decoding Given that LLM
may generate non-unique or incorrect outputs for
the same inputs, we use self-consistency filtering
(Wang et al., 2022) to select pseudo-labels. Specifically,
 we create a consensus output for each unique
input by selecting the most frequent answer  in
the case of ties, we heuristically select the shortest
answer. This promotes accuracy of the generated
dataset while ensuring unique examples.
Asynchronous Batching API requests are parallelized
 using zeno-build (Neubig and He, 2023).
We use additional mechanisms, such as dynamic
batch size and throttling, to optimize API usage.
3.4 Model Retriever
We need to select an appropriate model to finetune.
To support many tasks with a unified model
interface, we presently limit ourselves to encoderdecoder
 architectures on Hugging Face (Wolf
et al., 2020), following recent work that shows that
encoder-decoder models are more data-efficient for
model distillation (Calderon et al., 2023). This restriction
 still leaves a large set of pretrained models
to choose from, e.g. Salesforce/codet5-base
for coding-related tasks (Wang et al., 2021b) or
MaryaAI/opus-mt-ar-en-finetuned-ar-to-en
for Arabic-to-English translation (Tiedemann and
Thottingal, 2020). We frame the problem of selecting
 a pretrained model as a search problem. Using
the user s instruction as a query, we search against
all textual descriptions of models on Hugging Face.
This search task is challenging because Hugging
 Face model descriptions are sparse and contain
 lots of templatic text, often with only a few
words that signify the content of the model. To
address this, we follow the HyDE framework (Gao
et al., 2023) and first use gpt-3.5-turbo to create
ahypothetical model description given the user s
instructions. We show an example of a hypothetical
 document generated for a question-answering
instruction in Figure 3. Using this description as
an expanded query, we then apply the BM25 algorithm
 to compute query-model similarity scores
(Robertson et al., 1995). To ensure the ease of deployment
 of the resulting model, we filter out models
 whose size (in bytes) exceeds a user-specified
threshold (set to 3GB by default). Using the intuition
 that highly-downloaded models are more
likely to be high in quality, we choose the top model
after ranking by 
BM25(query,model ) log(# of Downloads   1).Your task is to generate an answer to a natural
question. In this task, the input is a string that
consists of both a question and a context passage.

Figure 3  For our model retriever, we first construct a
hypothetical model description for a query, then compute
 similarity scores between that hypothetical model
description and the descriptions of real models.
3.5 Training
Dataset Processing We train the model by leveraging
 two datasets- one generated and one retrieved.
 To sidestep the challenge of making
schema-specific modeling decisions (e.g. constructing
 specialized architectures for classification or
generation tasks), we treat all datasets as  text-totext 
 problems (Raffel et al., 2020). We textualize
the input columns of each dataset and prepend the
user s instructions to the input to guide the model.
Finetuning We concatenate the retrieved and
generated datasets and shuffle them before training
 the student model. We use the same default
hyperparameters for all tasks.3We train with the
AdamW optimizer with lr   5e-5 for 3 epochs,
which takes roughly one hour for all tasks.
3.6 Evaluation
OurModel Evaluator automatically evaluates models
 for all tasks using three general-purpose metrics 
 Exact Match ,ChrF   (Popovi  c, 2015), and
BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019). ChrF   balances
 precision and recall to assess text generation
 quality. Exact Match measures how often
the model output perfectly matches the exact reference.
 BERTScore captures semantic similarities despite
 different wordings or phrasings by comparing

are effective, but we plan on implementing hyperparameter
selection using generated validation data in the future.the model output and reference in the embedding
space. We use XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) as
the encoder for BERTScore to support multilingual
evaluation.
3.7 Web App Creation
We finally provide an optional step in
Prompt2Model to automatically create a
graphical user interface that allows downstream
users to interact with the trained model. This web
application, built using Gradio (Abid et al., 2019),
can then be easily deployed publicly on a server.
4 Experimental Setup
Tasks As a proof-of-concept, we test our system s
 ability to learn a model for three tasks 
 Machine Reading Question Answering   We first
consider a common use case where pretrained
models and training datasets are plentiful. We
use SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) as ground
truth to evaluate this setting.
 Japanese NL-to-Code   Code generation from
Japanese-language queries is a challenging scenario
 where prior work exists but no annotated
data or pretrained models are available. We use
MCoNaLa (Wang et al., 2023) for evaluation.
 Temporal Expression Normalization   We finally
consider a task where there are no pretrained
models or training datasets of any kind available.
Here we use the Temporal dataset of Wu et al.
(2023) as ground truth for evaluation.
Though Prompt2Model offers automated model
evaluation (on generated and retrieved datasests),
we use real benchmark datasets here to measure
our pipeline s ability to train accurate models.
LLM Baseline A primary goal of our work is
to train small models that can match or outperform
 LLMs. To measure success towards this goal,
we report the performance of gpt-3.5-turbo on
each benchmark. We provide gpt-3.5-turbo4the
same instruction and demonstrations provided to
Prompt2Model , for fair comparison.
5 Experiment Results

On 2 of 3 datasets, we find that Prompt2Model
produces models that are considerably more accurate
 than gpt-3.5-turbo . This is remarkable
because the retrieved model for SQuAD and Temporal
 is Flan-T5, which, at 250M parameters, is up
to 700 times smaller than gpt-3.5-turbo (which
is believed to contain 175B parameters).
We observe that Prompt2Model  s performance
on MCoNaLa s Japanese-to-Python task is significantly
 worse than gpt-3.5-turbo . One explanation
 for this is the relatively low diversity in the
generated dataset of Japanese queries  45 of 5000
examples are different ways of saying  find the
maximum value in a list of numbers . We do not observe
 this level of redundancy in our other datasets,
suggesting that gpt-3.5-turbo may struggle to
generate diverse text for non-English languages.
Another reason is the lack of an appropriate student
 model   the models found by the model retriever
 were trained on either on multiple language
or code, but not both. The resulting pretrained models
 may lack the parametric knowledge to represent
the Japanese inputs, Python outputs, or both.
5.2 Combining retrieved and generated
datasets is powerful
Ideally, generated and retrieved data should be as
close to the target domain as possible. In our experimental
 setting, where we deliberately choose
prompts that mimic existing datasets, we can evaluate
 how well the model performs relative to a
model trained on the same amount of data from theMethod #Train Performance Anno. Cost

Table 2  We compare model performance on SQuAD
on an annotation-cost basis, using datasets produced by
different modules of Prompt2Model , along with fullymanual
 annotation. Performance reported for all models
is the exact match on the test set,7which reflects the
true task performance . Cost of custom annotation is
estimated from Rajpurkar et al. (2016) using their reported

true dataset. We use SQuAD as a running example.5As
 our prompt is a description of the SQuAD
passage-level question answering task (Figure 1),
we exclude SQuAD from our retrieved datasets list.
Instead, we evaluate models finetuned on 
1.3k examples from the closest retrieved dataset6

3.The union of the above, which is what the full
Prompt2Model pipeline uses
4.3k examples from SQuAD (analogous to the
user custom-annotating data for a task).
Table 2 shows the results across these four settings.
 While using retrieved or generated data
causes a reduction in performance due to domain
shift, the combination of the two methods achieves
similar performance to using the true dataset. For
this machine reading comprehension task where
the user would need to custom-annotate data for
their task, Prompt2Model allows for similar performance
 at less than 1% of the cost .
5.3 Our generated evaluation data can
identify real modeling improvements
High-quality generated data should also allow us
todiscriminate between multiple candidate models
 to select a model that will perform well downstream.
 We finetune various models on a generated
dataset and rank their performance according to the
generated test data and the test data from the target
(real) dataset. We evaluate the Kendall s rank cor5We
 focus on only SQuAD here because our other two
tasks have less real training examples than the datasets we
generate, making comparison impractical.

to determine if our generated data can effectively
determine which models are likely to perform well
downstream. This is closely related to the concept
of concurrence between benchmarks (Liu et al.,
2023a)  however, we are evaluating whether the
generated and real data rank specific models in the
same ordering, rather than modeling approaches .
Table 3 shows the Kendall s τfor each task, computed
 over a set of reasonable models.8The generated
 data shows strong correlation to the true
performance on two of the three datasets.
6 Discussion and Conclusion
We propose Prompt2Model , a framework that
automatically constructs task-specific models using
 only natural language prompts. Our proofof-concept
 experiments show that, despite using
 a similar easy-to-use interface as LLMs,
Prompt2Model delivers small yet accurate models
 and its generated datasets can be used to estimate
 real-world performance. Besides our reference
 implementation providing a ready-to-use tool,
Prompt2Model  s extensible design and modular
implementation makes it a platform for advancing
 model distillation, dataset generation, synthetic
evaluation, dataset retrieval, and model retrieval.
We believe our Prompt2Model framework can
inspire various novel research questions. We hope
that our platform enables future work that looks
more deeply into quality assurance on the generated
data and the model. Interesting questions include
how much data should we generate for downstream
model training and how diverse should it be  How
do we effectively mix the retrieved and generated

metadata extraction and generated data do not align
with their intentions. We hope to propose explicit
challenges and invite the community to contribute
novel implementations of various components in
our framework.
Limitations
One of the primary limitations of our system is that
our current experiments have all been conducted
using the gpt-3.5-turbo API (used for prompt
parsing, dataset generation, and model retrieval).
This LLM is paid and closed-source, which makes
this problematic as a scientific artifact (Rogers
et al., 2023). Furthermore, the service provider of
this LLM, OpenAI, prohibits the use of their API
to create models that may compete with OpenAI,
creating potential legal concerns with the use of
Prompt2Model in commercial applications. We
are exploring the integration of open-source LLMs
to avoid our reliance on proprietary APIs.
Another limitation of our work is the limited ability
 of Prompt2Model to support tasks that require
processing languages other than English. While we
have shown the limitations of our system at supporting
 code generation from Japanese natural language
 queries, our system is likely to struggle more
with lower-resource languages. We use the unpublished
 gpt-3.5-turbo model for our Dataset Generator
 in our reference implementation. This model
is believed to be similar to GPT-3 (Brown et al.,
2020), which was trained on 93% English documents,
 1% German documents, 1% French documents,
 and  5% documents in any other language.
Our use of this model may exacerbate existing disparities
 in language technologies between highresource
 languages and low-resource languages.
One potential limitation is that we have only
tested our approach on 3 tasks, each with a single
dataset and a single evaluation metric. We justify
this decision because our focus is on providing an
extensible software system rather than establishing
state-of-the-art results on many datasets, but we believe
 that our results suggest broader applicability.Ethics Statement
Any system which makes powerful technology
more accessible to the public has ethical implications.
 Widder et al. (2022) discuss ethical issues
with open-source packages in relation to software
libraries for deepfaking, including the possibility
of enabling malicious actors to use technology that
they would otherwise not have the technical skills
to leverage. This is also a risk for an AutoML system
 such as Prompt2Model   however, we believe
this risk is outweighed by the benefits of greater
accessibility, especially given that a low barrier to
entry for generating harmful data already exists in
the form of prompted, web-interface models.
While Prompt2Model could, if given harmful
 inputs, generate toxic, offensive, or inaccurate
 synthetic data, this is no more of a risk with
Prompt2Model than it is with the underlying
prompted model (Bender et al., 2021)  indeed, the
use of models and supplementary datasets retrieved
from Hugging Face may lessen the likelihood of
a downstream model replicating harms from the
prompted model s outputs, though more investigation
 is needed. Like all ML models, the models
thatPrompt2Model returns can make mistakes,
and we aim to be transparent in our documentation
about potential limitations of the system.
We hope that Prompt2Model will be broadly
useful. Our work is motivated by a desire to increase
 the accessibility of NLP models to people
who are not in the NLP community but would benefit
 from the community s innovations  particularly,
to people who would use NLP models downstream
but may not have the domain-specific knowledge
to design their own system. Prompt2Model may
also prove useful for early NLP researchers by providing
 a starting point for intuitions about baselines
 for various tasks and enabling the discovery
of similarities between a described task and existing
 work. We open-source Prompt2Model and
welcome community contributions.
