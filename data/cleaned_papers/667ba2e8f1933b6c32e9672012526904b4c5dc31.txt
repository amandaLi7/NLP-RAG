Many recent improvements in NLP stem
from the development and use of large pretrained
 language models (PLMs) with billionsofparameters.
 Largemodelsizesmakes
computational cost one of the main limiting
factors for training and evaluating such models 
 and has raised severe concerns about
the sustainability, reproducibility, and inclusiveness
 for researching PLMs. These concernsareoftenbasedonpersonalexperiences
and observations. However, there had not
been any large-scale surveys that investigate
them. In this work, we provide a first attempt
 to quantify these concerns regarding
threetopics,namely, environmentalimpact ,
equity, andimpact on peer reviewing . By
conducting a survey with 312 participants
from theNLP community, wecapture existing(dis)paritiesbetweendifferentandwithin
groups with respect to seniority, academia,
andindustry  andtheirimpacton thepeerreviewing
 process. For each topic, we provide
ananalysisanddeviserecommendationsto
mitigate found disparities, some of which already
 successfully implemented. Finally, we
discussadditionalconcernsraisedbymany
participants in free-text responses.

 The group that suffers most from lack of resources
 are students, who struggle to reproduce

 from large industry.

our survey responses that  industry  has accesstosignificantlymorecomputepowerthan

the case for very few extreme outliers (6%).
Withthissurvey,wehopetoprovideamoresolid

make research more inclusive.
The survey was open over a period of 17 days,
fromMonday,July12,2021toThursday,July29,
2021. It was conducted via Microsoft Forms and
distributed across the *CL community by mass
mailingtoACLmembership,andsharedonTwitter.
During that time, we collected 312 responses. The
creation of the survey indicated that,  input willremainanonymousandtheresponseswillalsobe
summarized in aggregate form .1Therefore the
data will be made available on request with a statement
 of intended purpose, due to privacy and ethical
The questions were divided into four categories.
First, we collected some general information about
ourparticipants, liketheircurrentpositionand seniority
 ( 2.2). Second, we asked our participants
abouttheirconcernsregardingtheenvironmental
impact of NLP experiments ( 3) and their access
to computational resources ( 4). Finally, we asked
abouttheimpactofcompute-intensiveexperiments
onthereviewingprocessaswellasaboutspecific
measurements to alleviate them ( 5).
To keep a low-effort for our participants,
we crafted most of the ( 𝑄)uestions as simple
yes/no/unsurequestions. Forsubjectsthatrequire
a more fine-grained analysis (e.g., environmental
concerns)weusedfivepointscales(eithernumeric
ortext-based). Overall,weaskedatotalof19questionsfromwhich15weremultiple-choicequestions
(13 with a single answer possibility and two with
multiple possible answers). 𝑄4 (available compute
resources) and 𝑄11 (number of times reviewers
asked for expensive experiments) required a numeric
 answer. Finally, 𝑄9,𝑄18, and𝑄19 allowed
free text answers. Participants were asked to provide
 answers to 13 questions, while six questions
(𝑄4,𝑄9,𝑄11,𝑄12,𝑄14,𝑄19)wereoptional. All
questions are provided in Table 1.
2.2 Demographic Overview
In our first three questions, we asked the participants
 about their seniority, job sector, and geographic
Seniority. We asked our participants about the

author, reviewer, or in a related role ( 𝑄1). Overall,
a little over half (53.5%) indicated they were junior
members of the community, while the remainder
were fairly evenly split across mid- and late-career.
Job Sector. We further asked our participants
about the current position they are holding ( 𝑄2).

3 Environmental Footprint
We quantified existing concerns about the environmental
 impact of NLP experiments using a five
pointLikert scale( 𝑄7)and askedourparticipants
toselectthemostpressingissueinthetypicallife
cycle of an NLP model ( 𝑄8) between (Train)ing,
model (Select)tion, and (Infer)ence. Participants
wereallowedtoselect allapplicableanswersand
could select (None) or provide (Other) pressing issues.
 Theycouldalsoprovideatextualjustification
of their answer(s) ( 𝑄9).
Figure 3a shows that more than 50% of our participantsweremoderately(28.2%)orvery(27.9%)con-
cernedabouttheenvironmentalfootprintofNLP,
while around 33% of them were slightly (14.7%)
or somewhat (18.6%) concerned. 10.6% of participants
 were not concerned at all. Our participants
 further agreed that training(75.3%) and
model selection (59.9%) are the most pressing issues
 (Fig. 3b).3Inference took third place with

 many respondents considered inference
less pressing than training and model selection.
Job Sector. Although wedo not findsignificant
differences by seniority, we see larger (although
notstatisticallysignificant)differences whenlooking
 at the responses grouped by researchers from
different job sectors (Fig. 4a). We find that respondents
 from the large industry sector were mostly
somewhat concerned,whilethemedianforallother
groupsliesat oftenconcerned. Similarly,wealso
see larger differences in the most pressing issues

betweendifferentgroups. Forinstance,smalland
large industries were substantially more concerned
with respect toinference and muchless concerned
with respect to model selection than academia.
3.2 Discussion and Recommendations
Ananalysisofthe81(26%)free-textresponses( 𝑄9)
reveals diverse opinions about the environmental
impact of NLP and the reasons behind the most
pressingfactors. Forinstance,amongrespondents
thatstatedtobe notatall concernedaboutNLP s
environmental footprint, a majority considered the
impact of NLP research on climate change to be
negligible compared to other factors. Factors mentioned
 as being more relevant to climate change
include air travel (also mentioned twice in the general
 responses 𝑄19), cars, and more cost intensive
computations from other areas (of science). Another
 argument brought up multiple times in this
groupofrespondentsisthattheACLisnottheright
institution to tackle challenges of climate change.
Some responses alternatively suggested to push for
regulatorychanges,sincebigtechcompaniesmight
not be affected by decisions made by the ACL.
Regardingthemostpressingfactors,oneofthe
main arguments provided for inference was that industry
 spends most time on inference, hence it is
themostexpensiveone. However,participantsalso
arguedthatthereexistvariousmethodsforefficient
inference(see,e.g.,Trevisoetal.,2023). Prominent
argumentswithrespecttotrainingandmodelselectionwerethatthepressuretoachievestate-of-the-
 performance leads to extensive hyperparameter
tuning and that a large variety of models are being
trained during research and development (even if
just for debugging) without being ever deployed.4 Equity
The(in)equityoftheavailablecomputeresources
across groups (e.g., academia and industry) is an
increasinglybroughtuptopicindiscussions. While
thegeneralgistseemstobethatmanyresearchers
feelexcluded bynot havingaccess tosubstantially
large compute power (e.g., thousands of GPUs),
it often remains unclear whether this is really the
case. Oneofthemainobjectivesofthissurveywas
therefore to quantify such potential disparities.
For𝑄4,229participantsresponded(73.4%)with
the number of GPUs they have access to. Fig. 1
showsthedistributionofthetotalnumberofGPUs
across our participants (in %). Overall, we observe
a high disparity across our participants in terms of
access to GPUs. For instance, 62% of the participants
 had access to less than eight GPUs(Fig. 6a),
thenumberusedfortrainingacademicBERT(Izsak
etal.,2021),and87.8%oftheparticipantshadaccess
 to only 9.7% of the total number of GPUs.
15 participants (6.6%) had access to more than 100
GPUs, up to 3000 GPUs, representing 85.6% of
thetotalGPU count(  11.2k). An outlieranalysis
shows that 13.1% of the respondents had access
to a substantially higher number of GPUs (more
than 22 GPUs) than the rest. We further find that
57.4% of our participants were unable to run experiments
 dueto the lackof computational resources,
and36.2%hadnolackofresources( 𝑄5). Finally,

4.2 Discussion and Recommendations
While our survey highlights existing disparities,
particularly between small industry or academic
researchers and large industry, we also find that
thereexistsubstantialdisparities withineachgroup.
Most surprising might be the general disparity
we find across the field, as 87.8% of our participants
 had access to less than 10% of the total number
 of GPUs, and 62% had access to less then 8
GPUs. Only a very small faction of researchers
(2.2% of our respondents) had access to GPU compute
 (1000 or more) to train models with several
hundredsofbillionparametersforseveraldaysor
weeks. Many researchers, hence, could only finetune
 models which requires far fewer resources
thanpre-training(Zhouetal.,2021) whichisonly
possible when pre-trained model weights are available.
 Unfortunately, many recent models are being
kept private, which has intensified the discussion
about equity in the field (Togelius and Yannakakis,

6 Further Considerations
Finally,wediscusssuggestions( 𝑄19)thatdonotfit
intoanyofthepreviouslydiscussedtopics. From
the 67 free-text responses (21.5%), the two most
prominent topics were evaluation (11 respondents)
and emphasizing research over engineering (7 respondents).
Evaluation. 16.4% of the free-text respondents
touched upon the issue of evaluation and model
comparability ascurrentbenchmarksoftenfocus
on improving a single metric. One measure to
counterthistrendwouldbetoreportperformance
basedonParetofrontiersandtoconsiderthecompute
 budget along with the model performance. To
promote such curves, it would also be important
to release metadata including preprocessing and
hyperparameter choices that allows future research
to draw proper comparisons as well as to provide
concrete guidelines for reviewers.

were to actively promote more theoretical, or more

Other suggestions. Another suggestion worth
mentioningwasthecreationofaseparatetrack(four
respondents) eitherspecificallyforsmallmodels
orforindustrythatcannotpublishtheirmodels. Finally,
 there was also a call for more shared tasks
with limited resources such as the efficient NMT
challenge (Heafield et al., 2022) or the efficient inference
 task (Moosavi et al., 2020).

 regarding the environmental footprint of
NLP experiments with model training and model

found a high disparity among our respondents with
students and small industry researchers suffering
most from a lack of resources. There was a large
supportformeasurestoimproveequityandaccessibility
 across all respondents  most prominently for
anefficiencytrack,askingreviewerstojustifythe
petition for additional experiments, and the release
of small versions of pretrained models.
Considering the continuous increase of param-eters in PLMs (Zhao et al., 2023), one danger we
faceisthatexistingdisparitiesmayintensifyeven
further. However, we find that much can be done
tocombatthis,evenonanindividuallevel. Asaresearcher,
 by making our model weights, code, and
data publicly available  and as a reviewer, by being
consideratetowardstheavailablecomputebudget.

 the fact that we did not receive any responses
