Abstract
As hypothesized by the unified competition model (MacWhinney, 2007, 2017, 2021),
optimizing training schemes can enhance second language (L2) learning by foster ing
 various protective factors. Under such a framework, the current study focuses on
how the familiarity of stimuli will affect learning Chinese phonetic skills in a computerassisted
 language learning (CALL) environment. Two training conditions, i.e., training
with familiar stimuli from the textbook and unfamiliar stimuli from novelty design, were
administered for two groups of learners at American universities, where the classroom
instructions were integrated with the Pinyin Tutor an online spoken Chinese learning
 platform hosted under TalkBank. The results show that training with novelty stimuli
leads to a greater pretest posttest improvement for intermediate learners, whereas
more significant improvement has been observed in training with familiar stimuli
among beginning learners. The learning-enhancing power of the Pinyin Tutor is evidenced
 by the overall significance of the pretest posttest improvement when consolidating
 the results of the two conditions. Furthermore, high retention has been demonstrated
 in all six aspects of the Pinyin knowledge as tested by a three-month-after
delayed posttest. These findings tend to endorse a differentiated design of instructional
materials with increasing novelty components as the level of L2 learning advances.
The overall significant learning-boosting results accredit the design of the Pinyin Tutor,
where the technological architecture and algorithms were integrated with psycholinguistic
 and pedagogical theories. Suggestions and implications for smart learning in
general are presented.

Introduction
Research in the domain of second language acquisition has generally found that adults
are inferior to infants or children in the ability to perceive and produce novel foreign
speech sounds. It is challenging for adult second language learners to perceive the
speech contrasts that do not exist in their native language. A frequently cited example *Correspondence

is for non-native speakers to learn Chinese Pinyin tones (MacWhinney, 2017  Pelzl et al.,
2020  Wang, 2013). On the other hand, both prominent theories in second language
acquisition (SLA) and abundant empirical studies have shown that the ultimate attain ment
 of L2 skills is largely affected by training. An optimized training scheme facilitated
with effective instructional programs and tools can greatly, if not completely, offset the
age effect in learning a foreign language (Bradlow et al., 1999  Dupoux et al., 2001  Hopp,
2010  Kaan et  al., 2007  MacWhinney, 2017  Suzuki & DeKeyser, 2017  Wang et  al.,
1999). In particular, there has been considerable research showing the effectiveness of
various training strategies in facilitating the L2 acquisition of Chinese pronunciation and
phonetic knowledge (Li & Dekeyser, 2019  Showalter & Hayes-Harb, 2013  Wang, 2013 
Wang et al., 2003).
Despite the significant progress having been made, there are still critical issues under explored
 toward a complete understanding of how a foreign tone, or a foreign pronunci ation
 in general, is optimally acquired. The first observation is that most of the previously
reported results were based on short-spanned training, constituting an unrealistic rep licating
 of the actual learning. The briefness of the experiment has led to concern about
the long-term retention and real-world use of the learned skills, which, after all, is the
ultimate purpose of language learning (Li & Dekeyser, 2019  Pelzl et al., 2019). A second
observation is that most previous studies were administered in highly restrictive labora tory
 conditions. While favorable for many reasons, such as confounding factor control,
laboratory learning is dramatically different from language learning and use in a daily
context, which is far more dynamic and multidimensional. In addition, as noted by Pelzl
et al. (2020), for example, most of the previous studies focused only on the L2 supraseg mental
 learning of a single syllable, providing limited prediction to the learners  tonal
identification and production ability at lexical and above levels.
The current study aims to fill these gaps. Accordingly, a longitude experiment, span ning
 twenty-five weeks from the  pretest to the  delayed posttest, has been adopted by
the current study. Integrated with conventional classroom language instructions that
focused on the L2 development of Chinese in general, the current study examines how
the phonetic knowledge of multisyllabic words in Chinese could be improved by the
online training implemented at the Pinyin Tutor. The design of the Pinyin Tutor was
based on a large corpus analysis of the error patterns of the L2 production of Chinese
Pinyin, in addition to other innovative features of the platform, such as the in-depth pro filing
 of the learning data and the interactive feedback following each item being trained.
Despite the smart design, the Pinyin Tutor needs to be experimentally calibrated in
terms of to what extent such intelligent algorithms will be transformed into pedagogical
success and what general guidance could be drawn toward an effective smart learning
environment in the context of SLA.
Taken together, the experiment reported in the current work investigates how the
familiarity level of stimuli will affect the learning outcome of Pinyin for both beginning
and intermediate learners of Chinese as an L2 and how such Pinyin learning could be
effectively improved through the intelligent CALL environment offered by the Pinyin
Tutor. Through a sequence of online Pinyin training and dictation tasks spanned into
two semesters in two American universities, we observed an overall significant Pinyin
knowledge improvement under either of the training conditions. However, significant Page 3 19
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3

differences were found in the rate of learning gains for different sources of stimuli. It was
shown that training with novelty stimuli leads to a greater learning improvement than
training with familiar stimuli for intermediate learners. On the other hand, routine train ing
 following textbook stimuli leads to a more significant improvement for beginning
learners. These findings tend to highlight the importance of embedding the construction
of a CALL system with a diversified option of instructional materials and, in particular,
underscore how a differentiated feed of novelty stimuli should be catered to different
learners at different learning stages so as to efficiently foster their L2 development.
Theoretical framework and literature
It is often argued that adults are generally inferior in learning foreign speech. The criti cal
 period hypothesis (CPH) claims that the complete mastery of a foreign phonological
system is unattainable for adult L2 learners (Chiswick & Miller, 2008  Lenneberg, 1967 
Patkowski, 1990). Indeed, the results of many previous studies and experiments tend to
support the belief that the earlier one begins to learn an L2, the better they will pro nounce
 that language (Fathman, 1975  Flege et al., 1995  Moyer, 1999  Oyama, 1982  Pat kowski,
 1990  Tao et al., 2018  Thompson, 1991  Xiao, 2013, for example). On the other
hand, considerable studies have supported the idea that old learners, including adults,
are not necessarily inferior in terms of efficiency and levels achievable in L2 learning.
For example, Flege (1988) claims that  there is no conclusive support for the existence
of a critical period for human speech learning  . Krashen et al. (1979) argue that adults
actually learn a foreign language more quickly than children in the early stage, although
children may have a better chance of achieving native-like fluency. Hopp (2010) and
Donaldson (2011) show that ultimate attainment in L2 is comparable to that of first
language (L1), at least in certain aspects of language proficiency with appropriate train ing.
 Flege (2018) further emphasizes that input, not age, is the critical predictor of L2
proficiency.
A more comprehensive view from the unified competition model (UCM) is that the
ultimate attainment of L2 skills is the outcome of a complex mechanism co-functioned
by a variety of protective or risk factors from multiple dimensions. These multidimen sional
 factors constitute the underlay of the age effect and are dynamically alterable by
cognitive, behavioral, and environmental interventions (MacWhinney, 1987, 2007, 2014,
2017). Accordingly, adult learners  development of foreign speech should not be thought
of as static. In fact, considerable studies involving a variety of languages have supported
the view that auditory perception of language is not completely fixed in adulthood (Bra dlow
 et  al., 1999  MacWhinney, 2014  Yan & Sloos, 2019). Some studies indicate that
training can lead to improvement in the identification and discrimination of non-native
contrasts (Lively et  al., 1993  Ingvalson et  al., 2012), and even negative phonological
transfer can be corrected through repeated training (Crosson et  al., 2019  Donaldson,
2011  Flege et al., 1995). With training, non-native speakers of Mandarin Chinese can
improve their syllabic tone perception to near-native levels (Sung, 2012  Wang et  al.,
1999  Wiener et al., 2020). Other studies show that long-term laboratory training has led
to generalizable improvement (Bradlow et al., 1999  Suzuki & DeKeyser, 2017).Page 4 19 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3
In particular, the UCM of language learning emphasizes the role of L1 transfer, reso nance,
 and cue validity. In order to promote the acquisition of marked L2 phonemes,
adult learners must apply additional learning strategies, including the optimization of
high-quality input, selective attention, promotion of L2 resonance, and graduated inter val
 recall (MacWhinney, 2017). According to the classic competition model and the
UCM, a highly available and reliable cue will be attached with high strength and advan tage
 in competition (MacWhinney, 1987, 2014, 2017). Therefore, Chinese Pinyin learn ing
 is expected to be more robust if valid cues are effectively applied to guide a learner s
attention early in language acquisition. In the current study, we focus on the effect of
familiarity of stimuli on L2 learning performance, expecting to find out whether familiar
or unfamiliar auditory training is more effective in providing optimal contrast and best
helping learners to identify, perceive, and acquire the target L2 Chinese speech sound.
There are studies exploring the effect of material familiarity on L2 learning, but mainly
in the area of ESL. For instance, Channell (1981) recommends that words be taught in
semantically or orthographically homogeneous sets. Neuner (1992) claims that teaching
similar words at the same time requires less learning effort. Boers and Lindstrombergh
(2005) suggest that lexical chunks of alliterations, such as "jumping and jiggling" or "blue
balloon", are easier to learn because of the similar pattern of the components. Neverthe less,
 recent studies have suggested largely contrary conclusions. Nation (2000) argues
that "learning related words at the same time makes learning more difficult. This learn ing
 difficulty can be avoided if related words are learned separately". It is recommended
that "Teachers can decrease the possibility of interference by making the contexts, col locates,
 and visual representations of related words as different as possible". Erten and
Tekin (2008) show that the learning rate of semantically unrelated words is higher than
that of semantically related sets. Similar research studies have been done by LauferDvorkin
 (2006) and Kim (2016), showing that it is not necessarily effective to teach tar get
 words within the context of a mixture of familiar words, at least in the early stages
of learning. These controversial conclusions underscore the multidimensionality of SLA
hypothesized by the UCM, where the stimulus is co-functioning, in an interwoven man ner,
 with other factors, including scaffolding and chunking, for instance, towards the
overall success of L2 learning. The extent to which familiar or novelty words could be
facilitative in language learning is ultimately tied to whether they are finely tuned to the
L2 learners  developmental levels (MacWhinney, 2014, 2017).
The Pinyin Tutor implementation
Operated and maintained under TalkBank, the Pinyin Tutor is a web-based Mandarin
Chinese Pinyin learning and assessment platform programmed with Java. From the
learner s end, the Tutor is displayed through the dictation tasks of Chinese Pinyin, cov ering
 the pronunciations of all the syntactically possible words or phrases in Chinese.
The learners hear the pronunciation of a selected Chinese word by native speakers of
Chinese and are asked to enter the Pinyin syllables according to the instructed rules or
rules explained in the help menu. Intelligent feedback is provided on different types of
errors helping the learner to improve in the following trials. The learners have the option
to listen to the correct pronunciation and also to their own attempted pronunciation and
compare the subtle differences between the two. Such accurate and tailored feedback is Page 5 19
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3

possible with the Pinyin Tutor because the Tutor has been embedded with the database
of all the pronounceable syllables, close to 4000 in total, according to the Chinese Pinyin
rules. To date, more than 100 universities or high schools across the world have adopted
the Pinyin Tutor in their classroom teaching of Chinese. The following Fig.  1 provides
a snapshot of the part of the interface of the Pinyin Tutor, and Fig.  2 demonstrates that
the class performance profile can also be readily populated after the completion of each
training session. One worthy-to-note feature of the Pinyin Tutor, from a language learn ing
 and assessment perspective, is the embedded data analysis function programmed in
Java. Learners  L1 2 learning experiences are pooled upon regis tration.
 In addition, learning portfolios, such as the time of login and logout, the dura tion
 of the drill, the error type, the session-wise score, score breakdown, and the number
of attempts on each item, are automatically generated on a real-time basis upon comple tion
 of each training. In addition to helping learners or class instructors to optimize the
learning ladder, such a function also provides an essential empirical basis for educators
and researchers to calibrate and improve the existing pedagogical theories and practice.
The experiment of the current study trained two groups of learners learning Chinese
phonetic knowledge through the Pinyin Tutor. One group of learners was trained with
familiar words from the textbook and the other with novel words that are outside of the
textbook. The design of familiar and novel cues reflected the different roles they play
in phonetic knowledge development among L2 learners. By replicating a stimulus with
which a past activation was produced in the auditory cortex, a familiar word serves as
an anchor for the learner to recall a specific Pinyin pronunciation and spelling with less
cognitive load. However, novel words are expected to promote cue generality by allowing
learners to pick up more comprehensive knowledge that can be applied to new forms.
The rule of minimum pair was applied by the current study to design the novelty stimuli,
Fig. 1 6 19 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3
which consisted of new words that were structurally matched with words from the text book
 in phonetic spelling but with different meanings. For example, to match a textbook
word  jie shao4  (to introduce), a novel word  jie shou4  (to accept) not appearing in
the textbook was selected as the counterpart novel word. One worthy note is that all
novel stimuli designed were valid words in use in the contemporary Chinese language.
They were prompted to the learners with minimum variations, either in initial or final,
in comparison to those familiar words presented in the textbook so as to stimulate the
learner s generalized knowledge of Pinyin. From the UCM perspective, resonant practice
with familiar words is expected to be more suitable for novice learners to strengthen
their basic skills in auditory phonology, whereas novel words are more useful for more
advanced learners, whose metalinguistic awareness of the L2 will make such a generali zation
 more probable.
Method and procedure
Beginning learners of Chinese from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and intermedi ate
 learners from Pennsylvania State University (PSU) were invited to the experiment.
Because of the in  vivo nature of the study, not all invited students completed all the
Pinyin Tutor sessions. A student must have completed at least two-thirds of the offered
Fig. 2 7 19
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3

training sessions and attended both the pretest and the posttest for the corresponding
learning data to enter into the analysis. In addition, students with pretest score in Pinyin
knowledge above 90 were also not included in the subsequent analysis to minimize the
ceiling effect of test. According to these thresholds, there were effectively 58 36 intermediate learners from PSU who participated
in the current study. At the end of the training, students were asked to fill in a question naire
 surveying their language background, self-rated learning interest and diligence,
and evaluations of the Pinyin Tutor. From the survey, we have that the beginning learn ers 
 L1 backgrounds are English (41%), Korean (37%), Cantonese heritage language (5%),
Mandarin heritage language (5%), and others (12%). The L1 backgrounds of the interme diate
 learners are English (60%), Korean (16%), Cantonese heritage language (5%), Man darin
 heritage language (14%), and others (5%).
The allocation of participants at CMU was randomized according to the students  cam pus
 ID names provided to the Pinyin Tutor coordinator. Depending on the total number
of letters in the ID string being odd or even, a participant was assigned to one of the
two training conditions  the routine condition in which the stimuli were familiar words
from the textbook they were using and the corresponding lesson had been covered in
their Chinese class at the time of training or the novelty condition in which the training
stimuli were not the words in the textbook but were designed according to the rule of
minimum pair in comparison to words appeared in the textbook. At PSU, the allocation
of the participants was randomized in accordance with the label of the class in which a
student was enrolled. A randomly selected three classes of students were assigned to the
textbook or routine condition, and students from the other three classes were assigned
to the non-textbook or novelty condition. Class-wise pre-training proficiencies of the
intermediate participants did not exhibit statistical difference with p-value   0.70 for the
F-test for comparison of means of the pretest scores of the six classes.
All the online training sessions were conducted at the Pinyin Tutor at the TalkBank
(http // talkb  ank. org/ Pinyin/). A preliminary session was arranged before the pretest
focusing on the tutorial on how to use the Pinyin Tutor. In particular, the following rules
for entering Pinyin in the Pinyin Tutor were instructed and familiarized by the students 
1. Use numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) for the four tones. For example,  tóngxué  would be written
as  tong xue2  .
2. Use number 5 for the neutral tone. For example,  shénme  would be written as
 shen me5  .
3. Use  v  for the umlauted  ü  , as in  nv er2  for  nǚ é r  .
4. Punctuations (such as apostrophes or hyphens) are not accepted by the Tutor.
In the training, a learner is prompted by an audio recording of a word in standard Chi nese,
 after which they must correctly enter the Pinyin of the word. If the answer is cor rect,
 the student progresses to the next trial  if incorrect, they are given a second chance,
along with feedback regarding the difference between their form and the target. If they
fail on the second attempt, the Tutor remembers the incorrect word and presents it to
the learner later. On each trial, students also have the option of comparing the sound of Page 8 19 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3
the Pinyin that they typed with the target sound following each of the two Pinyin entry
attempts.
A pretest was administered at the beginning of the experiment for both beginning
learners and intermediate learners. The beginning learners received two weeks of con ventional
 classroom instruction and learning focusing on Pinyin knowledge before the
pretest was arranged in the following week, right after the Pinyin topic was covered.
The intermediate learners received a similar classroom introduction of Pinyin one or
two semesters ago and were provided with a class review of Pinyin lasting about 40 min
before the pretest was assigned to them in the following week. The pretest was com posed
 of 40 novel words, including eight monosyllabic words, 28 disyllabic words, and
four multisyllabic words. A posttest was assigned in the thirteenth week of the experi ment.
 A delayed posttest was conducted twelve weeks after the posttest. The posttest
and the delayed posttest used the same Pinyin items contained in the pretest but in rerandomized
 order. Students were only instructed to complete the Pinyin Tutor sessions
as part of the take-home assignments of the course they were taking. They were not
informed of the posttest or the delayed posttest after the training. Due to practical con straints,
 a delayed posttest was not administered for the intermediate learners.
Six training sessions were assigned biweekly as taking-home Pinyin exercises through
the Pinyin Tutor. Each training session contains 20 30 Pinyin items, depending on the
contents and vocabulary covered in the corresponding classroom instruction. Words
selected from the textbook were presented to students in the same order as they
appeared in the textbook vocabulary list. The novelty stimuli were chosen from a wide
pool of general words and were structurally matched with words from the textbook
according to the minimum pair rule of design. For example, a novelty counterpart of
 xue xi2  (to study) in the textbook could be  xue qi1  (semester) or  que xi2  (being
absent). Therefore, phonologically, the difficulties of words used in the two treatment
groups were equivalent, while semantically, the words in the textbook group were more
familiar to the learners.
A Perl parser partitioned all the training stimuli and the test items into initials, finals,
and tones to examine the accuracy rate and the error pattern for in-depth analysis. In
order to make sure that the confusion was not caused by the quality of the recording or
other technical errors, two native speakers were invited to evaluate the training stimuli
of the experiment. The testers accessed the online Pinyin Tutor and went through the
Pinyin training sessions exactly as the learners did. The testers  answers were parsed in
the same way as if they were student attempts. The mismatches between targets and
attempts of the native speakers were sorted out. These mismatches, accounted for 1.5%
of the total stimuli tried, were marked as special scenarios for further study, the cor responding
 items of which were not included in the subsequent analysis of the current
study.
Results and analysis
The first research question concerns which of the two training modes, training with
familiar or routine stimuli, is more effective for beginning learners of Chinese as
an L2. As indicated by the following Fig.  3 for pretest posttest comparison (sample
size N   28 30 for novelty) and Fig.  4 for pretest-delayed posttest Page 9 19
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3

comparison (N   25 16 for novelty), training with familiar stimuli
leads to a greater improvement among beginning learners, on average, in every compo nent
 of Pinyin knowledge, although the increments in word and syllable scores are typi cally
 substantially higher than those in initial and final. More specifically, as shown by
Table  1, the mean pretest posttest improvement of the routine condition is statistically
higher than that of the novelty condition in each component of Pinyin knowledge with
p-value   0.05 except in the initial component with p-value slightly higher than 0.10. This
relatively less significant difference in the performance of the initial component under
Fig. 3 Beginners  pretest posttest improvements under the two training conditions
Fig. 4 Beginners  pretest-delayed posttest improvements under the two training conditionsPage 10 19 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3
the two conditions is primarily an indication that the sub-lexical segmental perception
of Pinyin is relatively less challenging for L2 learners to acquire, although such acquisi tion
 in itself may not be strong enough to predict the speaking proficiency of Chinese
in a natural conversational context. Such a disparity in learning challenge between ini tial
 and word for novice learners was statistically significant at a 95% confidence level
with p-value   0.01 for the t-test on the pretest scores of these two components of Pinyin.
When it comes to the pretest-delayed posttest comparison, as shown by Table  2, the
advantage of routine training has dwindled so that the difference between the two train ing
 conditions is statistically significant, at a 95% confidence level, only in word, syllable,
and syllable without tone, whereas insignificant in initial, final, and tone. Again, such
subtle contrast in terms of at which component of Pinyin the routine training is more
strongly effective for beginning learners partially reflects the challenge to synthesize the
segmental and suprasegmental skills into the knowledge demanded at a higher frame work
 of language proficiency (MacWhinney, 2014).
As revealed by Tables  1 2, the improvement from the pretest to the delayed post test
 is greater than that from the pretest to the posttest for both training modes, dem onstrating
 that favorable retention is achieved from the Pinyin Tutor training. This is in
spite of the fact that such a difference is rather subtle and does not yet constitute a statis tical
 significance with p-value   0.1647 for testing the null hypothesis that the improve ment
 from pretest to delayed posttest is higher than that from pretest to posttest.
While an accurate account of the mechanism of retention is not trivial, the observed
strong performance in the delayed posttest appears to be well in line with the lag effect
of learning (Kahana & Howard, 2005). For instance, approximately eight days of inter val
 for recall was demonstrated by Kapler et al. (2015) as optimal for long retention of Table 1 Pretest posttest improvements among beginning learners

natural science knowledge. By providing a relatively more natural learning and recall ing
 environment, the approximately biweekly spaced and repeated Pinyin Tutor training
of the current study, spanning a semester-long period in total, exhibits the potential to
propagate the retention into the long future after training. Nevertheless, we leave the
post hoc explanation of the observed retention open to the confounding of other fac tors,
 including the motivation of the beginning learners, as many of this group of learn ers
 would continue to learn Chinese in subsequent semesters. In addition, there is also
one exception to the above observation  the pretest-delayed posttest improvement in
final is lower than that of the pretest posttest by 8.9% with p-value   0.3920 for test ing
 the null hypothesis that the two improvements are equal. A separate study of error
analysis based on the whole learners  corpus generated by the Pinyin Tutor shows that
diphthongs and nasal vowels pose persistent perceptional difficulties even to advanced
L2 1 background in Korean, for example. In particular, for
learners with L1 in Korean, the overall confusion rate in the Pinyin identification tasks
of the nasal vowel with glide, /iong/, is as high as 56%, compared to a low confusion rate
of 5% in the identification of /b/, the unaspirated dental initial in Pinyin. Overcoming
such persistent challenges entails the support of more advanced and focused training
schemes (MacWhinney, 2014).
It is also observed that learners under the textbook training condition universally
exhibited larger variances in their learning improvement compared to their counterpart.
With other conditions equal, routine training with familiar stimuli from textbook entails
the ability to infer the Pinyin rules from a limited, confined context. Benefits of such
training, from the UCM perspective, include efficient auditory access and processing,
easy formation of strong chunkings, and positive metalinguistic resonance and trans fer
 when the familiar stimuli effectively subserve a high cue validity. On the other hand,
familiar stimuli may also give rise to risk factors such as negative transfer and entrench ment
 in the auditory activation. Such polarized scenarios are inducive to the highly var ied
 learning improvements among beginning learners. The results show that novelty
stimuli, with their wide-sourced nature, have helped to smooth out such odds in the cur rent
 study.
The second research question hypothesizes that training with novel words will be
more effective than familiar words for intermediate learners. As demonstrated by Fig.  5,
the pretest posttest improvement of the group under novelty stimuli condition (N   15)
is significantly greater than that under familiar stimuli condition (N   21) in every com ponent
 of Pinyin knowledge. More specifically, as Table  3 shows, the learning-enhancing
advantage of novelty condition over routine condition is significant at 99% confidence
level (p-value   0.01) in syllable, syllable without tone, and initial dimensions of Pinyin
knowledge, while such an advantage is significant at 95% confidence level (p-value   0.05)
in final, tone, and word dimensions. The results are overall consistent with the pedagogi cal
 implications of the UCM, where the multifaceted dynamical nature of SLA neces sitates
 a graduated reformation of learning and teaching strategy finely tuned to the
learners  developmental level of linguistic and metalinguistic skills. In particular, propor tionally
 increasing the input of unfamiliar stimuli and exposure to more contextualized
circumstances should be inducing to effective chunking, positive transfer, and effi cient
 cortex activation. According to the curriculum and the learning experience of the Page 12 19 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3
intermediate learners, by the time of experiment, they should have learned the Pinyin
transcription system at least one semester before and have developed basic communica tive
 skills in all of the four aspects of the Chinese language, namely, listening, speaking,
reading, and writing. They supposedly have acquired about 150 300 lexical units of
Chinese, meeting the basic conversational needs in the daily scenes such as greeting,
dining, socializing with friends, and traveling. Thus it is not surprising that training with
novelty stimuli has more robustly sharpened these learners  perceptional sensitivity to
Pinyin and hence their dictation performance in the phonetic identification tasks. Put
broadly, the comparative benefit of novelty training to intermediate learners in the cur rent
 study is a manifestation of their generalized metacognitive readiness to encode and
process more diversified L2 information at lexical or above level.
Notwithstanding, as shown in Table  3 and Fig.  5, the pretest posttest improvements
among intermediate learners are generally smaller than those among beginning learn ers.
 This gap is firstly an indication of the floor effect of test as intermediate learners had
learned Pinyin before and had stronger metalinguistic abilities to rely on for the Pinyin

identification tasks in the pretest. However, the beginning and intermediate learners
were from different universities, implying the differences in the in  vivo instructional
style as well as the hardware supporting the Pinyin Tutor, which may facilitate or impede
the learning experience. It could also give rise to differentiations in the L2 course entry
conditions and, correspondingly, the differentiations in learners  backgrounds and learn ing
 motivation. Thus, the influence of such potential confounding factors should not be
ruled out when it comes to interpreting such a gap in the learning gain between the two
groups of learners.
Similar to that for beginning learners, an observation to highlight is that learners
under the routine condition generally demonstrated more significant variances in learn ing
 improvement relative to the learners under the novelty condition. However, such dis parity
 in variances is not as apparent as that for beginning learners, and there are also
exceptions to such observations in initial and tone. As discussed, training with famil iar
 words posits not only high benefits, such as efficiency in cue activation and auditory
processing, but also a high likelihood of entrenchment. The results tend to evince that
such a polarizing effect on learning performance variances could be mitigated by train ing
 with novel words from more diversified and more complete lexical sources.
An overall evaluation of the learning-enhancing effect of the Pinyin Tutor can be
achieved by combining the pretest posttest results for both the routine and novelty
training conditions. For beginning learners, as shown in Fig.  6, the consolidated percent age
 pretest posttest improvements are 67%, 52%, 36%, 21%, 21%, and 28%, respectively,
for word, syllable, syllable without tone, initial, final, and tone. And the corresponding
percentage improvements for pretest-delayed posttest improvements are 73%, 52%, 38%,
21%, 22%, and 31%, in the same order of the respective components of Pinyin, demon strating
 stronger long-term retention in comparison to the short-term acquisition. The
high retention of the syllabic level of Pinyin knowledge in the current study is consistent,
in principle, with a couple of previous studies regarding the acquisition and production
of foreign speech sounds, including Wang et al. (2003) and Li and Dekeyser (2019) for
Fig. 6 14 19 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3
the perception and identification of Pinyin tones. These findings, put together, under line
 the critical role of training in SLA in general. More specifically, the UCM postu lates
 the relative plasticity of the auditory cortex, allowing adult L2 learners to retune the
underlying mental representation toward foreign phonetic perception and production,
where the finely tuned input and training, along with scaffolding the individual differ ences,
 is the key inducing factor for such auditory plasticity to be exploited. For inter mediate
 learners, the overall effectiveness of the online training by the Pinyin Tutor is
also highlight-worthy in that the respective consolidated percentage pretest posttest
improvements are 15%, 12%, 5%, 6%, 4%, and 8% for the six components of Pinyin under
consideration, although these increments are substantially lower than those for begin ning
 learners primarily due to the floor effect of test among other potential confounding
factors.
Discussion
Two experiment conditions focusing on the types of word stimuli for the Pinyin Tutor
training were administered by the current study, with the awareness that an arrangement
of another randomized control group not using the Pinyin Tutor throughout the semes ter
 would provide a more comprehensive picture regarding to what extent the Pinyin
Tutor is advantageous in comparison to other conventional learning modes. Such a third
design was not adopted due to the in vivo nature of the experiment, particularly in that
all students who participated in the training were motivated not only by to enhance their
Chinese skills but also to earn course credit, thus expecting fairness in learning support
and resources. Nevertheless, a reckoning of the learning-enhancing power of the Pinyin
Tutor is still possible by comparison with the existing results on L2 phonetic knowledge
acquisition. For instance, previous research suggested that a two-week focused training
in lab conditions helped CFL learners to better perceive the tonal information of Chi nese
 by a 21% increase in accuracy as tested through Pinyin identification tasks (Wang
et al., 1999). Also, an average of 18% improvement in the Pinyin tone production among
American CFL learners was reported by Wang et al. (2003) after a two-week lab train ing.
 With a training length restricted to within one week, Wayland and Li (2008) dem onstrated
 that L2 learners of Thai improved, largely by less than 10%, their perception
of the tonal contrast in Thai. In the current study, the phonetic knowledge of Pinyin at
tone level improved by 31% in long-term retention among beginning learners of Chinese
through the training offered by the Pinyin Tutor. Moreover, the performance increment
in the word or syllable level is shown as even higher. Taken together, the Pinyin improve ment
 achieved by the participants in the current study, particularly those at the begin ner
 level, appears plausible enough to endorse the effectiveness of the Pinyin Tutor. This
said, all such comparisons should be taken with caution. First, the training conditions
were diversified in various aspects, including contents, duration, and intensity. More
importantly, one should be aware of the long-term difficulties in the perception and pro duction
 of a foreign speech, especially in real conversational contexts.
In the current study, the same set of Pinyin items was used, with the sequential order
randomized, for the pretest and posttest. The main benefit of such a design is the con sistency
 of the level of difficulty of the tests. The nature of the tasks in the current study,
i.e., to transcribe the Pinyin into its phonetic forms with tonal identifications instantly Page 15 19
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3

after listening to their pronunciations in a CALL environment, should warrant the com parability
 of test difficulty between the pretest and delayed posttest. One possible con cern
 is that one participant might have simply mechanically memorized the test items
in the pretest. Such a scenario is not likely the case in reality. First, the test items were
prompted to the participants in a very short time with randomized order so that it was
not easy to memorize them in such a brief acquaintance. Second, past studies show
that human memory, especially about context-void speech stimuli, is extremely brief
and may decay as quickly as in hours (Higgins et al., 2014). Furthermore, the posttest
or delayed posttest was not announced before or during the pretest, so the participants
had no motivation to memorize the test items. In addition, given the intensity of the
course and the typical high academic load of other subjects for a typical American uni versity,
 it is not likely that they sought additional venues and training programs, other
than those provided by the in vivo exercises, to learn Pinyin throughout the experiment,
which had also been qualitatively confirmed by the collected post-experiment survey. So
it is believed that the history factor should be confidently ruled out for the analysis.
In summary of the findings of the current study, guidance for constructing a smart
learning environment should start with the identification of the learning and instruc tional
 objectives that are both justifiable from subject theories and achievable through
pedagogical practice. In the setting of SLA, as concerned by the current study, the incre mental
 input of novelty stimuli with optimal scheduling is demonstrated as a supportive
instructional strategy towards enhanced learning. Another essential tip for smart learn ing
 is to meticulously address the learning needs with individual differences taken into
account, which may include tailored task design and interactive feedback, for instance.
Learners  profiling and learning data analysis are almost sine qua non for nowadays
smart learning environments (see also Zhu et al., 2016). These said, it is not our stand
to underestimate the multifacetedness and the challenges of designing, constructing,
and updating any smart learning environment at the practical level. Instead, a robust
and adaptable smart learning surroundings should allow for differentiating the overall
learning goal by focusing on a particular aspect of knowledge or a specific learning strat egy,
 such as the acquisition of phonetic knowledge of Pinyin using novelty stimuli as one
selective training option offered by the Pinyin Tutor in the current study.
Conclusion and limitations
The current study concerns the effect of the familiarity level of training stimuli on the
acquisition of Pinyin knowledge for L2 learners of Chinese. Two training conditions, i.e.,
training with familiar stimuli from textbook and unfamiliar stimuli from novelty design,
were administered to two groups of learners in terms of their initial L2 level. The results
show that training with familiar stimuli is more effective in facilitating the beginner s L2
development of Pinyin, whereas training with novelty stimuli is more effective for inter mediate
 learners. The results underscore the critical role of differentiated task design
and graduated input for optimally fostering the SLA as learners  metalinguistic ability
advances, as implied by the UCM. As shown, an approximately biweekly spaced selfmonitored
 online training spanning throughout a normal semester, with novel stimuli
designed pairing to the classroom-taught vocabulary, has proven to be  of significant Page 16 19 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3 2 acquisition of Pinyin knowledge at all dimensions.
These findings shed enunciating light on real pedagogical designs in terms of optimizing
the instructional curriculum and learning strategies.
The training in the current study was offered by the Pinyin Tutor at TalkBank. Consoli dating
 the results for the two treatment groups, i.e., the group under familiar stimuli and
the other under novelty stimuli, the learning-enhancing effectiveness of the Pinyin Tutor
has been confirmed. Particularly strong benefits have been observed among beginning
learners, with at least 21% pretest posttest performance increment in all the compo nent
 Pinyin skills under assessment. More importantly, equivalent or stronger retentions
of the acquired knowledge at all aspects have been proved by the delayed posttest. The
results are, in principle, consistent with or statistically more substantial than the consid erable
 previous studies regarding the perception and identification tasks of L2 speech
sound, e.g., Wang (2013), Wang et al. (2003), and Kaan et al. (2007). Given that the study
was based on the Pinyin learning at the lexical and above level and was administered in
a semester-long natural learning environment instead of restrictive lab conditions, the
results are also expected to shed fresh insights into the debate casted by studies such as
Pelzl (2019) where a relatively less confident picture in L2 acquisition of a tonal language
was suggested.
As reminded by MacWhinney (2017) and Yang et al. (2018), for instance, technology
in itself is not sufficient to benefit learning. Overall, the satisfactory performance of the
Pinyin Tutor underscores the importance of coherent integration of language learning
theories in the CALL design. One critical aspect of such design, as proved by the cur rent
 study, centers around optimizing the learning input and scheduling. For specific,
differentiated learning tasks with a finely tuned increment of novelty stimuli, coupled
with a graduated recall with a timeframe of around two weeks, have proven significantly
effective in fostering the acquisition of the lexical level of Pinyin knowledge as adult L2
learners progress from novice to higher levels. The Pinyin Tutor has also constituted a
plausible example where a successful CALL platform should be able to effectively inte grate
 with traditional classroom instructions, instead of seeking to completely replace
them, so that the benefit of face-to-face conversation with instructors is fully leveraged.
Broadly defined as an interactive media, the Pinyin Tutor is also flexible and robust to
integrate with other emerging learning modes, including situated learning and blended
and flipped instruction, that have been proven effective in enhancing knowledge acquisi tion
 in general (Tong et al., 2020  Wei et al., 2020  Zhu et al., 2016).
One limitation of such in vivo study is the difficulty of test administration and training
control. The large noise magnitude may partly account for the less significance of some
statistical parameters and hypotheses, such as the exceptionally high p-value of 0.1033
for the pretest posttest improvement comparison between the routine and novelty
training groups. A natural direction for future study is to administer similar experiments
with more uniform training conditions and fewer noises at various aspects so that the
educational performance of the Pinyin Tutor could be more fully evaluated on various
fronts. With a total number of participants of 58 throughout the pretest posttest experi ment,
 the sample size, although worked finely for ANOVA, is still limited when a more
rigorous quest is desired in terms of covariate structures of the large-number dimen sions
 of the L2 knowledge or prediction-focused modeling and validation. In addition, Page 17 19
 Zhang and MacWhinney  Smart Learning Environments            (2023) 10 3

future research should endeavor to include more types of learning factors as premised
by the UCM for completeness. Future upgrading of the Pinyin Tutor in hardware and
algorithmic construct is also commendable, including incorporating more speech pro cessing
 functions and developing mobile-friendly Apps.
