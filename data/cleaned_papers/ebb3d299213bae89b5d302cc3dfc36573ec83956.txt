Medical dialogue summarization is challenging
 due to the unstructured nature of medical
conversations, the use of medical terminology
in gold summaries, and the need to identify key
information across multiple symptom sets. We
present a novel system for the Dialogue2Note
Medical Summarization tasks in the MEDIQA
2023 Shared Task. Our approach for sectionwise
 summarization (Task A) is a two-stage
process of selecting semantically similar dialogues
 and using the top- ksimilar dialogues as
in-context examples for GPT-4. For full-note
summarization (Task B), we use a similar solution
 with k 1. We achieved 3rd place in Task
A (2nd among all teams), 4th place in Task B
Division Wise Summarization (2nd among all
teams), 15th place in Task A Section Header
Classification (9th among all teams), and 8th
place among all teams in Task B. Our results
highlight the effectiveness of few-shot prompting
 for this task, though we also identify several
weaknesses of prompting-based approaches.
We compare GPT-4 performance with several
finetuned baselines. We find that GPT-4 summaries
 are more abstractive and shorter. We
make our code publicly available1.
Medical dialogue summarization is a long-standing
challenge in NLP (LÃ³pez Espejel, 2019  Joshi
et al., 2020a  Chintagunta et al., 2021  Navarro
et al., 2022). Medical scribes write notes on
doctor-patient conversations in a predefined template
 called SOAP notes (Ullman et al., 2021  Podder
 et al., 2020), which contains sections for information
 from the patient, test results and observations,
 diagnosis, and the conclusion or treatment.
Medical summarization is challenging for several
 reasons. It requires dialogue understanding,
where data is often limited (Dai et al., 2020  Lin
1https //github.com/Raghav1606/SummQAet al., 2020)  this is compounded by the sensitive
nature of medical information, which restricts the
release of training data for this task (Johnson et al.,
2023). Doctors and patients may discuss several
conditions in the same conversation, requiring the
scribe to differentiate (Gidwani et al., 2017  Mishra
et al., 2018). Scribes often use medical terminology
 in the notes that are not present in the doctorpatient
 conversation (Corby et al., 2020). Additionally,
 medical summarization is a high-stakes
domain (Naik et al., 2022), motivating several efforts
 to build explainabile systems for this task (Jain
et al., 2022  Reddy, 2022). In parallel, research on
large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
compelling few-shot capabilities across domains
(Brown et al., 2020  Perez et al., 2021).
In this paper, we explore several potential applications
 of a recent LLM, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023),
on medical summarization. We use GPT-4 and finetuned
 BioBERT (Lee et al., 2020) as an ensemble
for classifying the section headers of medical summaries,
 a 20-category classification problem. Then,
given a candidate section header, we apply Maximal
 Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and
Goldstein, 1998) to select examples for a fewshot
demonstration and use these examples to prompt
GPT-4 for section-wise summarization. This approach
 outperforms finetuning BART (Lewis et al.,
2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) over the limited
available data. For full-note summarization, we
take a similar approach, but select only a single
example for the demonstration due to the increased
length of the inputs. This also outperforms our supervised
 baselines. We outline several additional
potential prompting approaches and compare their
Applying LLMs for medical summarization is a
compelling solution to the data scarcity problems
in this domain, and we find promising performance,

for Subtask B. However, we also identify key areas
for improvement. We analyze the differences in
outputs between the settings in output length and
extractive ability. We find that the summaries generated
 by LLMs tend to be shorter and less extractive
than human-generated summaries as well as SOTA
fine-tuned biomedical summarization models. We
also note the impracticality of this approach for
real data, due to privacy concerns.
Dialogue2Note Summarization was one of two
tracks in the MEDIQA-Chat 2023 shared task (Ben
Abacha et al., 2023). The track was further comprised
 of two tasks.Task A involves generating a section-specific
clinical summary from a conversation between a
patient and a doctor. Additionally, Task A includes
a classification task  assigning each dialogue an appropriate
 section header. There are 1200 conversations
 in the training split of the dataset (Ben Abacha
et al., 2023) for Task A. The distribution over the
section headers in Task A is a long-tailed distribution,
 displayed in Figure 2.
Task B involves generating a full note summary
given a conversation  these summaries were evaluated
 on the section-level and the full-note level.
There were 67 conversations in the training split of
the dataset (Yim et al., 2023)  these dialogues and
reference summaries are significantly longer than
those for Task A, as these dialogues encompass an
entire conversation between a patient and a doctor.
The distribution of the difference in dialogue and
summary length for both tasks is shown in Figure
Summarization In recent years, fine-tuning pretrained
 models on domain-specific datasets has
been the leading practice in text summarization
research. While these models produce high-quality
summaries and earn high scores against standard
benchmarks, they require large datasets in order to
adapt to specific domains or summarization styles
(Lewis et al., 2020). Transformer-based models

GPT-4 PredictionFigure 3  System Architecture for Section Header Classification (Task A)
network models (Joshi et al., 2020b) have been finetuned
 with medical domain knowledge to produce
summaries that achieve state-of-the-art results.
Maximal Marginal Relevance was created to reduce
 redundancies in multi-document summaries
(Goldstein and Carbonell, 1998). Abdullah et al.
(2023) used MMR to generate query-focused summaries
 from pre-trained models without performing
fine-tuning. (Ye et al., 2022) use MMR to select
examples for in-context prompting.
The success of prompt-based models such as
GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has allowed for learning
 from natural language task instructions and/or a
few demonstrative examples in the context without
updating model parameters. In news summarization,
 Goyal et al. (2022) find that GPT-3 summaries
were preferred by humans over summaries from
fine-tuned models trained on large summarization
datasets  they posit that zero-shot summaries avoid
pitfalls from low-quality training data that are common
 in summaries from fine-tuned models. In the
biomedical domain, pre-trained language models
and few-shot learning has been used to collect and
generate labeled data for medical dialogue summarization
 (Chintagunta et al., 2021). Recent work
has used GPT-4 to pass the USMLE without any
specialized prompt crafting (Nori et al., 2023) and
perform zero-shot medical evidence summarization
across six clinical domains (Tang et al., 2023).
Few-shot learning Few-shot learning can be unstable
 as the prompt format, training examples, and
even the order of the training examples can cause
accuracy to vary from near chance to near state-ofthe-art
 (Lu et al., 2022). Recent work on prompting
 has tried to mitigate these problems through
techniques such as calibration (Zhao et al., 2021),
prompt combination (Zhou et al., 2022), or auto-matic prompt generation (Gao et al., 2021).
To mitigate any instability caused by a model s
bias, Zhao et al. (2021) estimated the bias towards
each answer by asking for its prediction when given
the training prompt and a content-free test input
such as  N/A  and then fit calibration parameters
that cause the prediction for this input to be uniform
across answers. To date, studies in prompt combination
 are rooted in paraphrasing-based methods
that take a seed prompt and paraphrase it into several
 semantically similar expressions. Typically
simple ensemble methods (Zhou et al., 2022) such
as Maximal Marginal Relevance (Mao et al., 2020)
are used to combine the answers to the different
prompts as to provide each prompt to contribute to
A number of techniques have also been proposed
for selecting fewshot examples (Rubin et al., 2022).
Fewshot techniques often rely on selecting optimal
 examples from a large dataset  some work has
shown that this leads to an overstatement of fewshot
 performance, as a large number of labeled
examples are necessary to select good examples for
the fewshot prompt (Perez et al., 2021). We note
that we use the full datasets (1,200 examples for
Task A, 40 for Task B) for our prompt selection
4 Methodology and Baselines
Our summary generation pipeline remains the same
across the two tasks  we use GPT-4 to generate a
summary given kin-context examples.
4.1 Task A - Section Level Summary
Task A is composed of two subtasks, namely the
section header classification and the section-level
summarization. We discuss our approach for eachMiniLM

of the subtasks below.
4.1.1 Section Header Classification
For the section header classification task, we create
an ensemble of two models  BioBERT (Lee et al.,
2020) and GPT-4. We fine-tune BioBERT with the
training data provided for task A. We leverage GPT4
 to perform zero-shot classification on a sample
with a given prompt (shown in Table 7). During our
analysis of each model s performance, we observe
that each model is more accurate than the other on
a distinct subset of classes. To leverage the varying
 nature of predictions from the models we build
an ensemble classifier. The overall accuracies are
shown in Table 2. We observe empirically that our
prompting-based approaches do not perform well
on three of the section headers  ROS (Review of
Systems), GENHX (History of the present illness),
and CC (Chief Complaint), To create an ensemble
classifier, we select BioBERT s predictions when
it classifies a dialogue as one of these three section
 headers, and we select the prediction of our
GPT-4 based pipeline otherwise. We present the
architecture of our final model in Figure 3.
4.1.2 Section Summary
To generate summaries for a given section, we
follow a multi-step process as shown in Figure
4. We encode each dialogue in the training data
with MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020). For each dialogue
 to be summarized, we calculate cosine similarities
 with encoded dialogues from the training
data. We retrieve k 7 similar examples from the
training data based on the highest similarity. This
similarity search, using cosine-similarity, serves as
a prompt selection method, and the resulting few-shot prompts, with k 7 are then fed to GPT-4 along
with their section headers to obtain a summary for
the given section. We provide the prompt templates
used in Table 7. We select k 7 as this fits well in
the context length of our prompting-based pipeline 
we perform an analysis with varying kin section
4.2 In-context Example Selection for
This approach involves the dynamic selection of
in-context examples for each example during validation
 or testing. This process entails utilizing
matching or similarity criteria to compare the input
dialogue of a specific example to a candidate pool
comprising the complete training set. Through this
process, we are able to select the most suitable examples
 for each individual case, thereby enhancing
the efficacy of our prompts.
Semantic Similarity Here we select the kmost
similar examples (dialogue and summary pairs)
based on semantic similarity between the provided
input dialogue and the input dialogues in the training
 set. We store the selected examples and generate
 prompts which we then evaluate on the validation/test
Maximal Marginal Relevance We select kfewshot
 prompts using Maximal Marginal Relevance
(MMR). Similarly to Ye et al. (2022), we use MMR
to select an example and use it as a one-shot example
 for prompting. Our choice of MMR was
motivated by the idea that the diversity in the selected
 in-context examples of the prompt would
help with some generalization .4.3 Task B - Full Note Summary
For the summarization of entire dialogues, our goal
is to generate a full note containing all the appropriate
 sections. We use a similar approach as described
 in section 4.1.2 but we restrict it to k 1
similar examples from the training set and include
section-level headers in the prompts to help the
model understand the sections in the sumary. We
selected one in-context example due to long example
 length relative to the context window of the
model. The one-shot prompt is then again fed to
the GPT-4 model to obtain a full-length summary.
4.4 Baseline Approaches
We also consider a variety of baseline approaches
including, supervised fine-tuning of T5, zeroshot/few-shot
 GPT-3, perspective-shifting the dialogue
 followed by summarization, two-stage
prompting, our similarity-based in-context learning
 applied to GPT-3, and mixing of extractive/abstractive
We fine-tuned the T5-small model for the end-end
full-length summarization task (Task B). We finetuned
 for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001.
Our objective was to obtain a basic model that can
serve as a benchmark to assess the complexity and
difficulties associated with this specific task. We
find that this finetuned model significantly underperforms
 our other methods, with a ROUGE-1 of
20.187  this may be due to the small dataset for
finetuning or a non-optimized set of hyperparameters,
 as we do not do extensive hyperparameter
We investigated several prompting strategies and
approaches using text-davinci-003 .
Zero-shot prompting For Task B we used the
prompt template mentioned in the Appendix A,
where we specified the dialogue to be summarized
with an instruction prompt mentioning the 4 main
sections usually reported in the SOAP notes - "HISTORY
 OF PRESENT ILLNESS", "PHYSICAL
EXAM", "RESULTS" and "ASSESSMENT AND
PLAN". The zero-shot prompt gave us a reasonably
high ROUGE-1 score of 45.911.4.4.3 Few-shot prompting for section-wise
For Task A, we employed text-davinci-003 fewshot
 prompting strategy. Initially, we grouped and
categorized the existing 20 section headers for the
dataset into 4 main sections, namely "HISTORY
OF PRESENT ILLNESS", "PHYSICAL EXAM",
"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN", and "RESULTS".
The categorization scheme is detailed in Table 6.
It is worth noting that "Medications" can be categorized
 under either "HISTORY OF PRESENT
ILLNESS" or "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN" and
therefore appears in both categories. We created
four few-shot prompt templates, each comprising
k 5 in-context examples, for each section. For
each example in the validation set, we selected the
appropriate prompt based on the classified section
Perspective Shift In this method which we evaluated
 for Task B, we adopt a two-stage prompting
approach where we first use gpt3.5-turbo to obtain
a third-person narrative from the input dialogue,
following Bertsch et al. (2022), and use the thirdperson
 perspective narrative generated as input to
atext-davinci-003 model to generate a summary
using the same instruction prompt specifying each
section header that needs to be generated.
Two Stage Prompting In this approach we defined
 two chained prompts applied one after the
other in a stage-wise manner. The first stage prompt
was "List the important points from the above conversation
 for a medical report". This generated a
list of salient points summarizing the dialogue. The
second stage prompt we used was "Create a paragraph
 from the above facts only". The output from
this prompt served as the final summary, which we
then evaluated. We opted for these specific phrasings
 in the second prompt to mitigate the issue
of model hallucination, which we observed was
prevalent when tasked with generating a medical

5.2 Experimental Results
Our experiment involving prompt selection via semantic
 similarity with GPT-4 yielded the most
favorable outcomes on the validation split, and
prompt selection was the best approach for both
Task A and Task B. We propose that the remarkable
 performance of prompt selection is attributed
to the in-context examples that were selected using
 semantic similarity with the input dialogue.
This approach facilitates the generation of an
example-specific prompt that incorporates similar
in-context examples, leading to an improvement
in the model s ability to produce summaries that
are more relevant and precise. The use of semantic
similarity allows for the identification of examples
that share similar semantic structures with the input
 dialogue, thereby increasing the likelihood of
generating coherent and accurate summaries.

5.3 Length of Generated Summary vs.
As shown in Figure 5 we see that most generated
summaries were shorter than reference summaries
across tasks. This difference was more pronounced
in Task B and therefore the summaries produced by
our approach fall short in length thereby affecting
the ROUGE-1 score as the number of matching ngrams
 is less. However, we observe that the BERT
score still remains consistent even while producing
Another interesting observation is that individual
 section summaries, when combined together
to produce a full-length summary are closer to the
original length rather than prompting GPT-4 to generate
 a complete summary together. Hence, ensembling
 multiple section-level summaries to produce
a longer summary is an approach we can explore
further. We also tried multiple prompt templates
(refer Table 7), encouraging the model to produce
longer summaries. However, the fact that we require
 a summary induces the model to be concise.
5.4 Extractiveness of Summaries
We measure the extractiveness of the generated
summaries using three measures namely. extractive
 fragment coverage (EFC) (Grusky et al., 2020),Figure 5  Difference in length of reference summaries and generated summaries
extractive fragment density (EFD) (Grusky et al.,
2020) and compression ratio (CR) (Grusky et al.,
2020). These metrics rely upon the concept of
extractive fragments which are defined as shared
sequences in the dialogue and the summary. The
extractive fragment coverage quantifies the percentage
 of words in the summary that are a part of the
extractive fragments in the original dialogue. The
extractive fragment density measures the average
length of the extractive fragment to which a word in
the summary belongs to. Compression is measured
as the fraction of words in the article and summary.
A comparison of the extractiveness and compression
 ratio of the reference and generated summaries
are shown in Table 3. For Task A, the relatively
poor extractive performance of our proposed methods
 could be due to the smaller size of generated
summaries which prevents the usage of more terms
from the dialogue. In Task B, we observe the extractive
 capability of our model improving. This
could be attributed to the larger dialogues in Task
B allowing for a larger candidate space of tokens
to be used in the generations. The generated summaries
 in Task B are still smaller than the reference
summaries as shown by the compression ratio.
5.5 Impact of the number of in-context
We further evaluate the impact of the number of
in-context examples (k) on various metrics. We
report the metrics in Table 5. We observe a general
improvement across all metrics as we increase k.This implies that the generated summaries improve
as the model is given more access to relevant data
through in-context examples. The relevancy in our
method is brought in through the selection of incontext
 examples via semantic similarity/maximum
marginal relevancy. This experiment was only performed
 for Task A since the token limits of the
models did not permit the ablation of kfor Task B.
6 Future Work and Conclusion
This paper attempts to automatically generate summaries
 or structured SOAP notes from a conversation
 between a doctor and a patient. We tackle this
problem by generating section-wise summaries,
classifying these summaries into appropriate section
 headers and generating full-length summaries
from longer conversations.
We conclude from the results that promptingbased
 techniques by themselves can not perform
optimally themselves but do give some outstanding
results when combined with existing techniques,
like prompt selection using MiniLM. Next, we also
dive deep into where prompting-based methods
underperform the standard models like BART and
Overall, our model concluded 3rd amongst all

Considering the critical nature of the domain of the
task, it is of paramount importance to ensure stability
 in the results expected from the model. Despite
setting the temperature (T) as 0 for all decodings
in our experiments, we observe the variance in the
generated summaries across runs. Table 4 contains
the results for three runs for Task A and Task B.
The in-context examples for each sample and other
parameters have been kept constant across these
runs to identify the degree of stochasticity. Further,
in-context learning has shown to be susceptible to
changes in order of in-context examples (Lu et al.,
2021), as well as the template of the examples (Shin
et al., 2020). A more reliable process to generate
the summaries along with identification of the optimal
 examples (template, order) is thus required.
Additionally, due to the context limit of the GPT-4
model, evaluating the impact of natural language
instructions in addition to the examples could not
There exist several risks and ethical considerations
that necessitate comprehensive addressal prior to
the deployment and utilization of our proposed
methods utilizing Language Models (LLMs). A
significant apprehension associated with employ-ing LLMs for summarization, as evidenced during
experimentation, is their susceptibility to hallucination.
 This means that there would need to be stringent
 and effective fact-verification post-processing
on the generated summaries, thereby ensuring their
factual accuracy and alignment with the doctorpatient
The preservation of patient confidentiality and
privacy assumes paramount importance within the
context of healthcare data, given its highly sensitive
and personal nature. Consequently, it becomes imperative
 to undertake effective data anonymization
techniques to safeguard patient identities. Additionally,
 obtaining explicit consent from patients
regarding the utilization of their data assumes critical
 significance. In tandem, strict adherence to the
standards set forth by the Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is essential
to ensure compliance and guarantee the privacy and
security of patient information.
Furthermore, another vital aspect that demands
careful consideration is the explainability and interpretability
 when utilizing Language Models
(LLMs) for medical summarization. It becomes
essential to address the challenge of comprehending
 the decision-making processes underlying their
outputs. Particularly within the medical domain,
where critical decisions are made based on these
outputs, explainability is of great importance.
