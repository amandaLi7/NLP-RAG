ABSTRACT
Consumer speech recognition systems do not work as well for
many people with speech diferences, such as stuttering, relative
to the rest of the general population. However, what is not clear is
the degree to which these systems do not work, how they can be
improved, or how much people want to use them. In this paper, we
frst address these questions using results from a 61-person survey
from people who stutter and fnd participants want to use speech
recognition but are frequently cut of, misunderstood, or speech
predictions do not represent intent. In a second study, where 91
people who stutter recorded voice assistant commands and dictation,
 we quantify how dysfuencies impede performance in a
consumer-grade speech recognition system. Through three technical
 investigations, we demonstrate how many common errors can
be prevented, resulting in a system that cuts utterances of 79.1%
less often and improves word error rate from 25.4% to 9.9%.

Performance of speech recognition systems has improved substantially
 in recent years, leading to widespread adoption of speech
input across computing platforms. Speech is especially important
for devices with limited or no screen real estate, such as smart
speakers (e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Nest Audio) and hearables
(e.g., Pixel Buds, Apple AirPods), where it is used for everyday
tasks like playing music, searching for facts, and controlling smart
devices in the home [4]. Yet, speech interaction presents accessibility
 barriers for many people with communication disabilities such
as stuttering, dysarthria, or aphasia [9, 28, 46, 58]. In this work,
we investigate user experiences and speech recognition system
performance with one large population in this demographic of
communication disability  people who stutter (PWS).
Stuttering, also called stammering [66], impacts approximately
1% of the world s population, although estimated incidence ranges
from 2% to 5% for sub-populations such as children and males [20].
Stuttering is a breakdown in speech fuency that can afect the rate
and fow of speech and can include dysfuency types such as sound
repetitions ( p-p-pop ), syllable repetitions ( be-be-become ), word
or phrase repetitions ( mom, mom, mom ), sound prolongations
( mmmmmom ), and audible or silent blocks (pauses or breaks
in speech) [57, 60]. Frequent interjections ( um ,  eh ) are also
common. The rate, duration, and distribution of these dysfuencies
varies substantially between people and across contexts [64].
Research on speech technology for PWS has largely focused
on technical improvements to automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models [31, 35, 50, 51, 61], dysfuency detection [22, 40, 42, 48], and
dataset development [12, 37, 42, 55]. This body of work has largely
lacked a human-centered approach to understanding the experiences
 that PWS have with speech recognition systems [17], which
CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Lea et al.
could in turn inform how to prioritize and advance technical improvements.
 A recent exception from Bleakley et al. [13] conducted
an interview and diary study on the use of voice assistants with
11 PWS. That study provides an initial understanding of user experiences
 with a voice assistant, identifying issues with the device
timing out and that social pressure can infuence use. There are still
open questions, however, in how PWS more broadly experience
speech technologies (i.e., not just voice assistants), the prevalence of
accessibility challenges encountered, how these experiences relate
to stuttering severity and specifc dysfuencies, and how speech
recognition systems perform and can be improved in the context
of these reported challenges.
In this paper, we report on two studies designed to address these
questions of user experience and system performance for both
voice assistants (VAs) and dictation  a survey on the use of speech
technology with 61 PWS, and an investigation of VA and dictation
system performance on speech data collected from a larger set of 91
PWS (53 of whom overlapped with the survey). Both studies characterize
 what attributes, including prevalence of dysfuency types,
tend to impact experience and cause recognition errors. Furthermore
 each study highlights ways in which speech systems could be
improved to support the nuanced speech patterns of PWS. Overall,
the fndings show that speech technologies work reasonably well
for some PWS with mild speech dysfuency patterns, as refected in
both the survey and performance data of those. However, people
with more moderate or severe patterns encountered high truncation
 (e.g.,   20%) and word error rates (13.6% to 49.2%) which is
also refected by many survey participants. Motivated by these results,
 we describe and evaluate three technical solutions (two new
and one previously published [51]) that apply production-oriented
improvements to a consumer-grade ASR system. These solutions
reduce truncation rates by 79.1% and improve word error rates in
transcribed speech from 25.4% to 9.9% for a set of participants with
moderate to severe dysfuent speech.
Overall, this paper contributes an understanding of the subjective
experiences that PWS have with VAs and dictation across a range
of stuttering severities, confrms and refects those experiences
through performance evaluation with a commercial ASR system,
and demonstrates the utility of three technical improvements that
can be applied with relatively small adaptations to existing systems.
While continued efort is needed to improve these technologies for
people with speech disabilities, as frequently noted in popular press
(e.g., [19, 24, 67]), our solutions start to narrow the performance
gap for many PWS and potentially improve performance for people
with other speech disabilities as well.
2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
2.1 Speech Recognition Systems
In this section, we describe common pipelines for Voice Assistants
and Dictation Systems, to build an understanding of how people use
them and how the underlying models work. In Section 3 4 we
demonstrate how dysfuencies impact performance of constituent
models.
2.1.1 Overview of Speech Recognition Systems. Voice Assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant).
 These systems listen for spoken questions or commands.
For example,  What is the weather   or  Set a timer for fve minutes. 
 A typical user fow is as follows, where a simplifed view is
shown in Figure 1. A user may initiate a query by saying a wake
word, such as  Alexa ,  Hey Siri , or  OK Google.  This may also
be called invocation. They then start vocalizing their command.
As the user speaks, an ASR model starts to transcribe their words
and simultaneously an endpointer model also called end-of-speech
detector detects whether the user has fnished speaking.1 A Natural
 Language Understanding (NLU) model then takes the transcribed
phrase and any metadata from the ASR and identifes the user s
intent, which is then sent to the Decision Making component to
perform the appropriate action. Based on the user s query, the VA
may respond with information, perform a command, ask the user a
follow-up question (i.e.,  is the alarm request for AM or PM ), or
notify the user that the query could not be understood.
There are alternative ways of interacting with a VA. Instead of
using a speech-based invocation mechanism on a phone or tablet,
a user may hold down a button on the side of the device ( Hold
to Speak  on iOS) or squeeze the side of the phone (some Android
devices). VAs can also be invoked using accessibility features such as
Accessibility Menu on Android or Assistive Touch on iOS. Instead of
speaking, a user can type a command with a keyboard using  Type
with Alexa  or  Type to Siri.  This bypasses the ASR component
and may directly process the input text through NLU.
Dictation Systems. These systems provide an alternative to using
a keyboard by converting a user s speech to text for tasks such as
composing text messages, notes, or emails. A common use case is
to verbalize a text while in a car. Typically, a user starts dictation
by manually clicking a button on a device, instead of via a wake
word, and they fnish by manually clicking a button again, instead
of relying on an endpointer. An ASR model may transcribe their
speech in real-time and visualize the text if the device has a screen. A
punctuation model may add grammatical structure to spoken words,
like adding commas and periods. Finally, if the ASR model yields
low confdence in a predicted word, this word may be highlighted
on screen along with suggestions for replacement. A user can then
manually revise their statement or click on low confdence words
for suggestions.
2.1.2 Model Descriptions & Implications of Dysfluencies. To refne
speech technologies for PWS, we focus on endpointer and ASR
models independently. Endpointer models are optimized to balance
the trade-of between cutting someone of too early and having a
long delay after their speech, and implicitly or explicitly rely on
cues such as how much silence has elapsed since the last word (e.g.,
[44, 45]). These models are largely optimized on data from people
who do not stutter, and are tuned to respond to the user with as low
latency as possible. For PWS, as described by Bleakley et al. [13]
and in Sections 3 4, endpointer models commonly cut of before
the user is done speaking, especially during blocks where there
may be a long pause or gasp, or even partial word repetitions where
the vocalization may be indecipherable.
1For simplicity, Figure 1 shows the endpointer and ASR in sequence. In practice,
endpointers range from being independent of an ASR [45] to fully integrated [44]. Enabling People Who Stuter to Beter Use Speech Recognition CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany

(1
At a high level, ASR models (e.g., [15, 32, 36, 71]) commonly
consist of an acoustic component that encodes low-level phoneme
or phone-like patterns, a language component that acts as a prior
over word sequences, in some cases a pronunciation component
that describes the phonetic pronunciation of words (e.g., for hybrid
ASRs [36, 41, 59]), and a decoder that may map these together and
generate candidate transcriptions. For PWS, we hypothesize that
sound, syllable, or partial word repetitions fed into the acoustic
component may have lower confdence phone- or phone-like outputs,
 as these models may not be trained with large amounts of
dysfuent speech. Similarly, the language component may not be
trained with word or phrase repetitions, meaning these repetitions
may have lower likelihood and be misrecognized. Furthermore, interjections
 mid-word or partial word repetitions may cause errors
when paired with a pronunciation dictionary and decoder, as there
may be spurious phone-like units interspersed with known words.
It is worth noting that while VAs and Dictation often rely on
the same underlying ASR system, a VA s model may be tuned to
work better for a smaller set of assistant commands [ 31], whereas
Dictation may be biased towards free speech from arbitrary topics.
In addition, for VAs, an NLU model (e.g., Chen et al. [16], which is
used in this paper) may take an erroneous transcription and map it
to the correct action using context and error cues. This means that
individual ASR errors may play a more important role in Dictation
than for VA tasks.
2.1.3 Dysfluent Speech Recognition. Technical work on improving
speech assistants for PWS has focused on ASR models [8, 23, 31, 35,
50, 51, 61], stuttering detection [43], dysfuency detection or classifcation
 [22, 40, 42, 48, 56], clinical assessment [11], and dataset development
 [12, 37, 42, 55]. Shonibare et al. [61] and Mendelev et al. [50]
investigate training end-to-end RNN-T ASR models on speech from
PWS. Shonibare et al. introduces a detect-then-pass approach that
incorporates a dysfuency detector where audio frames with dysfuencies
 are ignored entirely by the RNN-T decoder. Examples in the paper demonstrate how this approach can be used to ignore some
partial-word repetitions and blocks. Alharbi et al. [2, 3] focused on
stuttered speech from kids that incorporates the structure of repetitions
 and other dyfuencies into an augmented language model
that is better at including dysfuencies in a transcription. In our
work, we focus on solutions, like Mitra et al. s [51], which can be
applied on top of existing recognition systems and do not require
as much data as end-to-end solutions. Their VA-oriented approach
was to optimize a small set of ASR decoder parameters on stuttered
speech, such that the system is biased towards common VA phrases,
and was efective in removing dysfuencies such as repetitions in
speech. One limitation of that work is that it was only applied to
speech from 18 PWS, so in this paper we validate results on our
much larger 91 person study.
2.2 Accessibility of Speech Recognition Systems
Voice interaction is used by a wide range of people with disabilities 
such as the speech input that enables many people with motor
disabilities to control computing devices (e.g., [18, 72]), and as an
inherently accessible input modality for many blind and low vision
users (e.g., [1, 54]). However, this work often assumes that speech
input itself is accessible.
Researchers have captured speech input challenges encountered
by people with dysarthria [9, 46], deaf or hard of hearing people
 [28], and people with aphasia [58]. For stuttering specifcally,
there has been relatively little human-centered work [17]. A recent
exception comes from Bleakley et al. [13], who report on interviews
and a three-week diary study of smart speaker use at home with 11
PWS. While participants had  some success  in using the device,
challenges included the device timing out, social pressure when
using the device around other people, and difculty with specifc
sounds (especially those that could interfere with the wake word,
i.e.,  OK Google ). Participants reported repeating and reformulating
 utterances to overcome these issues. While this study provides CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Lea et al.
an initial understanding of how PWS use VAs, stuttering severity
of the participants is not reported, and an objective assessment
indicating how well the smart speakers recognized their speech is
not provided. In contrast, our study examines speech input technology
 more broadly (e.g., including dictation), and includes both
quantitative subjective data from a larger sample of n 61 91 PWS.
A few other human-centered projects have looked at supporting
speech therapy for PWS and at managing stuttering in everyday
life. Demarin et al. [25] and Madeira et al. [47] both present apps to
record stuttering experiences with the goal of increasing awareness
and informing therapy decisions  small user evaluations included 2 5 PWS, respectively. Focused on managing speaking situations,
Fluent [29] supports people in writing scripts that they will be
more likely to read aloud fuently. The tool uses active learning
to identify words that the user is likely to encounter issues with,
and suggests alternative words that may be easier to speak  no user
study has been reported. Finally, McNaney et al. [49] employed
a multi-stakeholder co-design process to design StammerApp, a
mobile app that allows users to set goals, practice, and refect on
their experiences in especially challenging situations. While the
project did not focus on speech input, it provides a qualitative
understanding of a total of 39 participants  experiences with stammering,
 including specifc challenges (e.g., talking on the phone),
and a general desire to be able to  stammer openly and feel more
confdent and relaxed with their own voice.  Ultimately, our goal is
for PWS to have this freedom and confdence when interacting not
only with other people, but with speech input technology as well.
3 SPEECH TECHNOLOGY SURVEY FOR PWS
Our frst goal is to understand the experience of speech technology
 for PWS, including how well existing systems are perceived
to work, what challenges arise, and areas for improvements. We
accomplished this by deploying a comprehensive online survey
to 61 PWS in the United States during a three-month period in
mid-2022.
3.1 3.1.1 Survey Design and Protocol. Screened participants flled out
the survey online using a commercial survey website. The survey
took 30 60 77 questions depending on conditional
logic.

Many of these questions had multiple choice responses and openended
 text input to further explain responses. For questions related
to the endpointer and other technical material, layperson descriptions
 like  How often does a VA cut of your speech  were used.
See the Appendix for the list of survey questions discussed here.
3.1.2 Participants. Participants were recruited through social media,
 referrals from speech-language pathology clinics, and word
of mouth. To participate, individuals had to self-identify as having
 a stutter, after which they signed an Informed Consent Form
and were screened by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) who listened
 to their connected speech patterns. Stuttering characteristics
such as frequency, duration, and distribution of dysfuency types
can vary greatly across individuals [64], thus we aimed to recruit
a broad range of participants with diferent stuttering severities.
While there are many clinical severity assessments (e.g., [57, 70]),
we chose the Andrew & Harris (A&H) Scale [ 6] which can be performed
 entirely using audio recordings. The SLP performed this
assessment by examining dysfuency rates in audio recordings of
a participant reading a passage, talking impromptu about a topic
of their interest, and speaking with other individual(s). The result
was a grading of mild (0-5% of words have dysfuencies), moderate
(6-20% of words), or severe (  20% of words) stuttering.
With the A&H scale, 12 participants were rated as having a
mild stutter, 31 as moderate, and 18 as severe. When asked about
whether people understood their speech, almost all participants
(93.4%, n 57/61) reported that friends and close contacts  always 
or  usually  understand their speech, however this was lower for
acquaintances (73.8%, n 45) and strangers (67.2%, n 41). Many
individuals noted that their speech qualities change day-to-day
(65.5%, n 40) or throughout the day (55.7%, n 34) and on top of
typical dysfuencies such as blocks, prolongations, and repetitions,
their voice may be strained (42.6%, n 26) or breathy (16.4%, n 10).
Most individuals noted that speaking requires  some  physical efort
(67.2%, n 41) with fewer responses of  very high  (11.4%, n 7) or
 very low  (9.8%, n 6).
In terms of demographics, there was an even gender split between
 men (50.8%, n 31) and women (49.2%, n 30), with no participants
 reporting another gender. Most participants were under 40 18-19 (n 2), 20-29 (n 28), 30-39 (n 21), 40-49 (n 3),
50-59 (n 4), 60-69 (n 2), and 70-79 (n 1). Individuals identifed as
white (n 38), black or African American (n 12), Hispanic (n 5),
Asian (n 2), American Indian or Alaska Native (n 1), or preferred
not to answer (n 3). In terms of technology use, all participants
owned smartphones, with most having an iPhone (93.4%, n 57)
and four having an Android phone. Over half (59.0%, n 36) had
smart speakers in the home  27 had an Amazon device, 5 had a
Google device, and 4 had an Apple device. For other technology,
58 participants reported having a computer, 35 had a tablet, and 27
had a smartwatch or ftness tracker. Enabling People Who Stuter to Beter Use Speech Recognition CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany
3.1.3 Analysis. For closed-ended questions, we report primarily
on descriptive statistics including counts and proportions. We have
included a few comparative statistical tests for high-level questions
of how often participants use VAs vs. dictation, and whether there
is an impact of stutter severity ratings on usage. In doing so, we selected
 tests that are appropriate for ordinal data  Mann Whitney U
and Kruskal Wallis tests. For open-ended questions, we conducted
two open coding passes on each question and report on the prominent
 themes identifed in this analysis to help contextualize the
quantitative results.
3.2 Survey Findings
We present survey results including an overview of speech interaction
 and usage, challenges related to both VAs and dictation, and
factors beyond technical considerations that could impact future
adoption.
3.2.1 Speech Interaction Usage and Utility. Most participants were
familiar with speech recognition systems (VA  100%, n 61 90.2%, n 55), although more had used VAs (96.7%, n 59) than dictation
 (73.8%, n 45). Overall, among participants who were familiar
with the given technology, VAs were used signifcantly more often
than dictation (Mann-Whitney U test2 1937, 1 59, 2 53,
   .019). As shown in Figure 2, about half of the participants familiar
 with VAs used one on a daily (32.2%, n 19/59) or weekly basis
(20.3%, n 12/59), whereas fewer used dictation on a daily (15.1%,
n 8/53) or weekly basis (24.5%, n 13/53). This VA usage rate is
somewhat lower than recent estimates for the general population
in the US that suggest 57% use VAs daily and 23% do so weekly [53],
perhaps refecting the accessibility barriers faced by PWS.
Because past work has shown that stuttering severity afects
speech recognition accuracy [51], we further examined the relationship
 between A&H severity ratings and reported dictation and
VA usage. These results, shown in Figures 3 indicate no clear patterns
 based on graded severity. Kruskal Wallis tests did not reveal
signifcant impacts of A&H severity level (i.e., mild, moderate, and
severe) on reported frequency of use for either VA usage or dictation
 usage.3 This lack of signifcance may be due to low statistical
power related to our sample size and variability in how people rate
their frequency of use, but we return to additional considerations
in Section 5.
Turning to how and why participants adopted VAs and dictation,
 we frst examined what platforms they used. Among people
with experience using VAs or dictation, phones were the most common
 platform (VA  84.7%, n 50/59 88.9%, n 40/45) followed by
2We used a Mann Whitney U test because this is ordinal data and the data was not fully
paired not all participants who had used VAs had also used dictation. This analysis
excludes the two participants who answered  I don t know  for their usage of VAs and
dictation. Participants who were familiar with but had not used a given technology
were combined with those who had used it but reported their current usage frequency
as  never,  as shown in Figure 2.
3A Kruskal Wallis test is a non-parametric equivalent to a one-way ANOVA, and is
appropriate for ordinal data such as our frequency of use ratings (i.e., 1-At least daily,
2-At least weekly, 3-At least monthly, 4-Less than monthly, 5-Never). We conducted
two separate Kruskal Wallis tests to examine the efect of the independent variable of
A&H severity level (mild, moderate, or severe) on the dependent variable of frequency
of use for each of VA and dictation use. The tests were not signifcant at    .05
for both VAs ( (2)   0.57,    .752) and dictation ( (2)   1.53,    .465). These
analyses were conducted on    57 participants (VA) and    43 (dictation) who had
reported experience with the given technology and frequency of use. smartwatches (VA  25.4%, n 15 24.4%, n 11) and car infotainment
 systems (VA  25.4%, n 15 20.0%, n 9). Smart speakers
were also relatively common for VA use (47.5%, n 28) but not used
as much for dictation (9.0%, n 4) which is expected given that
smart speakers are often communal devices and have fewer dictation
 use cases. Ten or fewer participants had used speech on tablets
or traditional computers for both VAs and dictation.

with which participants feel diferent recipients, including
VAs, dictation, and other people, understand their speech
accurately. For dictation and VAs, this analysis includes participants
 who had reported experience using each technology
(n 44 for dictation because one participant did not answer
this question). Overall, for both VAs and dictation, the majority
 of participants felt these systems understood their speech
at best  sometimes,  in contrast to much higher comprehension
 rates when speaking to other people.
For why they use speech technology, a majority of participants
fnd speech recognition systems to be at least  somewhat  useful 
 see Table 1a for detailed utility ratings. For those surveyed
that use VAs, common use cases generally mirror those from the
general population [4]. For VA users (Table 1b), participants most
commonly reported listening to music, making phone calls, asking CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Lea et al.

general questions, checking the weather, setting alarms and timers,
and sending messages. For dictation users (Table 1c), the common
use cases were writing text messages, taking notes, writing email,
and dictation within a web browser. However, about a quarter of
participants familiar with each of the two speech technologies felt
that they were  not very  or  not at all  useful. Overall, reasons were
split between participants who saw no inherent value in VAs (e.g.,
 I haven t felt a need for them in my life  [P2-51]) and those who
encountered accessibility challenges due to stuttering (e.g.,  [...] I
often have to repeat myself so many times for it to understand me that
it s quicker and easier for me to just use my hands [...]  [P2-64]). We
examine these and other challenges in more detail in the following
sections.
3.2.2 Voice Assistant Challenges. To understand the range of challenges
 PWS face when using VAs, we asked about what factors
prevented participants who were familiar with VAs from using them
more often. The most common were  voice assistants cut of my speech before I fnish talking  (61.0%, n 36/59) and  voice assistants
don t understand my speech well enough  (57.6%, n 34). Indeed,
as shown in Figure 2 (b), a majority of participants (54.2%, n 32)
felt VAs only recognized their speech  sometimes  or worse. As a
result, many participants (37.3%, n 22) reported  often  or  always 
attempting to revise what they say due to inaccuracies in speech
recognition. Other concerns, however, were not purely technical.
Twenty-two participants (37.3%) reported not wanting other people
to hear them talking to the VA, refecting a social consideration
that past work has also identifed [13]. As well, many participants
(22.0%, n 13) cited that it takes  too much physical efort for me
to speak.  Only six participants (10.2%) responded that perceived
utility of voice assistants prevented them from using the technology
more often.
Concern with endpointing being cut of too soon is typically
more relevant to VAs than dictation, and was identifed as a challenge
 in Bleakley et al. s [13] interviews on VA use with 11 PWS.
Our data demonstrates the pervasiveness of this problem  almost
half of participants stated that VAs cut them of  always  (3.3%,
n 2) or  often  (37.7%, n 23), while an additional 31 participants
(50.1%) reported being cut of  sometimes  or  rarely.  For the 57
participants who had at least some experience being cut of, when
asked if they knew why it happened, by far the most common explanation
 was that there was a pause or block in their speech and
the system thought they had fnished speaking (77.2%, n 44 57).
Being cut of could also have consequential impacts, such as a poor
user experience described by [P2-42]   The [smart speaker] which
I use most often does not like any hesitations in speech. It assumes
the slightest pause means the person is done speaking. So I get cut
of often. It creates a sense of having to rush which makes my speech
worse.   And, as [P2-77] described, impacts can also be emotional   I
block a lot on my name and vowel words so when I take time to talk
it is frustrating when they cut me of [...] I have to deal with people
often trying to speak for me and having a voice assistant doing that
because I can t have one who understands my speech rhythm makes
me not want to use it even more.   We address endpointing errors in
Section 4.2.1 and signifcantly reduce the problem on our dataset
of speech samples.
Some smartphones (e.g., Apple iPhone) ofer an alternative to
automatic endpointing, where the user can push down a button
(physical or virtual) while speaking and only release it when done.
Twenty-seven participants (44.3%) reported using a device that supports
 this functionality. Of those 27, almost all found being able to
press a button and speak to be useful  51.9% (n 14 27)  extremely
useful,  18.5% (n 5)  very useful,  and 29.6% (n 8)  useful.  Reasons
provided for this utility were most commonly that it eliminates
being cut of, but some participants also explicitly referred to a
psychological impact of feeling less rushed or worried, such as   I
can fully get my phrase in without worrying about blocking  [P1-62]
and  I don t feel rushed to fnish what I need to say  [P1-45].
Another potential issue unique to VAs is invocation. Most VAs
use a wake word like  Alexa,   OK Google,  or  Hey Siri  for invocation,
 which can be difcult for some PWS to use. Almost half
of participants reported that these wake words  always  (11.5%,
n 7) or  often  (36.1%, n 22) worked for them. But, problematically,
 17 participants (27.9%) reported wake words only working
 sometimes  and 8 participants reported  rarely  or  never  (13.1%)  Enabling People Who Stuter to Beter Use Speech Recognition CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany

the remaining participants had not used a wake word. While we
did not ask participants to elaborate on their use of wake words,
a handful of responses to other open-ended questions referred to
challenges with wake words, including [P2-1] who stated  Problem
with wake words is my biggest frustration. I would want to change
it to something I can say easily . While popular consumer systems
do not allow for arbitrary wake words, some ofer multiple options
(e.g., Alexa has at least fve options and Google Assistant has two).
Additionally, a few participants mentioned that pressing a button
to talk (as described above) eliminated issues with wake words by
allowing an alternative explicit signal that the user is ready to talk.
[P1-28] noted  It s [Hold/Squeeze to Speak is] useful on my phone
to bypass the lag that occurs when [the VA] does not recognize me
using the wake phrase , and [P1-73] uses it  Because it knows when
to start listening and when I m done.  
3.2.3 Dictation System Challenges. As with VAs, we aimed to broadly
understand what factors impact dictation adoption for PWS. When
asked what reasons prevent them from using dictation more often,
56.4% (n 31) of the 55 participants who were familiar with dictation
 noted that  dictation tools don t understand my speech well
enough.  Of those who had used dictation, a majority (59.1%, n 26 44 who answered this question) felt the ASR only recognized
their speech accurately  sometimes  or less (Figure 2, right). As a
result of these errors, participants reported attempting to revise
or restate what they say, with about half of participants doing so
 always  (6.7%, n 3/45) or  often  (42.2%, n 19), and an additional
35.6% (n 16) doing so  sometimes.  Finally, and similar to VAs, participants
 also commonly cited non-technical reasons for not using
dictation more, most notably the physical efort it takes to speak
(32.7%, n 18 55 familiar with dictation) and not wanting other
people to hear them dictate to the device (30.1%, n 17). Additionally,
11 participants (20.0%) reported that low utility prevented them
from using dictation more often, and 12 (26.7%) felt that they use
more refned language when they type than when they speak.
In contrast to VA systems, which predict the most likely command
 based on a spoken phrase, with dictation the user s speech
is transcribed verbatim. This diference is refected in participants 
experiences with dictation errors. When asked an open-ended question
 about what types of errors tend to occur with dictation, by far the most common response, mentioned by a majority of participants,
 was errors in the ASR transcription (e.g.,  Message contains
diferent words than I intended  [P2-5]). Some participants (13.3%,
n 6) also mentioned being cut of, although this was a much less
common error than with VAs because many dictation systems do
not use an automatic endpointer. A few participants mentioned poor
performance with punctuation, proper nouns, and slang. Finally,
some participants mentioned specifc stuttering characteristics and
challenges, including their repetitions being displayed in the transcribed
 text ( Misunderstood due to repetition or actually repeats
word  [P2-46]), the impact of blocks ( words that I have a block in
the middle of will turn into a strange phrase  [P2-51]), and interjections
 being shown, as described by [P2-77]   because I have blocks
and use fller words, the fllers are listed on the text message all my
disfuencies are written down and when I read over the text it makes
no sense and I have to type it myself instead because I will never be
fuent all the time.  
3.2.4 Beyond Technical Considerations. The fndings above suggest
that technical improvements in invocation, endpointing, and ASR
accuracy should be welcomed by many PWS and ultimately increase
adoption of speech technologies by this population. However, future
adoption also depends on factors beyond technical improvements,
such as social concerns and the physical difculty of speaking,
emphasizing that speech input may not be relevant to all users even
with substantial accuracy improvements.
To begin to understand what future adoption might look like,
we asked participants to imagine speech technologies that can accurately
 understand their speech. Within this context, most participants
 were at least  somewhat  interested in VAs (86.9%, n 53/61) 
 extremely  (n 25),  very  (n 13),  somewhat  (n 15),  not very 
(n 7),  not at all  (n 1) and similar for dictation (Figure 3, right).
Positive responses refected earlier feelings about VAs and dictation,
notably increasing efciency, ease and convenience, being able to
do actions hands-free (including while driving), and generally having
 confdence in the system. For example, [P1-66], who currently
uses VAs at least monthly and has not tried dictation wrote,  I would
be extremely interested in this, especially knowing it s something I
don t have to worry about the speech input being able to understand
me. It would remove my hesitancy and frustration with my stuttering
from the equation.   CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Lea et al.
However, the negative and neutral reactions to this future technology
 scenario indicated a preference for typing, seeing no need
for speech input, and value depending on context (e.g.,  It would
depend on the device  [P1-64], who uses VAs weekly and dictation
less than monthly). This preference for typing by some participants
also arose in other responses throughout the survey, refecting
in some cases the physical efort required to speak. For example,
[P2-73] said,  It s a nice thought but it s still easier for a person who
stutters to type most of the time. Unless our hands are flthy or tied up 
and [P2-87]  It still requires efort to speak even if it understand me
perfectly, and I am good at controlling them manually.   In addition,
9.8% (n 6) stated  voice assistants don t seem useful.  while [P2-51]
said,  I m not sure. As someone who stutters, and just situationally in
my life, I can t imagine dictation regularly being a more convenient
option than typing.  
Additionally, social factors may infuence future adoption, a
consideration touched on in past work with PWS [13]. While the
survey did not explicitly ask participants about the social context of
speech technologies, as already noted, many participants felt that
having to speak in front of other people limited their willingness
to use speech technology. For example, [P2-1] wrote  [...] I would
be reluctant to use voice commands in public because of my speech
impediment , and [P1-58] wrote,  I still would not use it at work. I
would use it in spaces where I am alone, with my spouse or family.  
Some participants also commented on how anxiety afects their
stuttering, which translated to speech technology use in diferent
ways. [P2-88], for example, expressed that  ...before I am about to
use voice recognition I get a bit nervous because I think that I have
to speak without stuttering for it to work   a concern that could be
alleviated with improved ASR. At the same time, some participants
expressed that speaking to devices reduces anxiety compared to
speaking to other people, including   I don t stutter much when
talking to myself so I usually don t experience this problem [dictation
errors]  [P2-15] and  I usually stutter in high anxiety situations not
when I m by myself  [P2-70]. Depending on the individual person
and the context of use, these social factors could prove to be barriers
to adoption.
3.3 Summary
This survey shows that many PWS are using speech technology on
a regular basis, albeit at lower rates than the general population
(at least for VAs). However, accessibility challenges include being
cut of or misunderstood by VAs, and having stuttering events
such as repetitions and prolongations result in transcription errors
with dictation. Many participants were interested in using future
technologies that could recognize stuttered speech accurately, but
other responses suggest that a subset of PWS would still choose
not to use such technology due to the physical efort of speaking
and social considerations.
4 SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY 
DATA & EXPERIMENTS
Building on fndings from the survey, we turn to recorded speech
data from 91 PWS (53 of whom also completed the survey). We
quantify how dysfuencies in speech from PWS manifest in the
types of recognition errors encountered by survey participants. We also investigate changes to three stages of the speech pipeline
introduced in Section 2.1 that address issues identifed in the survey.
We focus on interventions that build on pre-trained productiongrade
 models, as oppose to training from scratch, so we can optimize
on relatively small amounts of data from PWS 
(1) Tuning the endpointer model using speech from PWS, to
reduce speech truncations (cut-of speech).
(2) Tuning the decoder in the ASR model using speech from PWS,
to increase ASR accuracy.
(3) Applying posthoc dysfuency refnements to ASR transcriptions
 to remove dysfuencies such as repeated words.
4.1 121 10 Dictation phrases that they could imagine
saying to a smart speaker or device. An initial cohort of 50 participants
 (Phase 1 25 18 7 severe)4 2020 41 additional (Phase 2 0 26 15 severe) in 2021.5 VA phrases were based on prompts
where participants came up with their own utterance to accomplish
 a given task. This was designed to prevent participants from
simply reading pre-defned phrases in a monotone manner, and
some examples include  Find out when a place you might want
to visit will open,   Find the lyrics to a song that you like,  and
 Ask a question about something that is not well known.  Dictation
phrases consisted of fake text messages that they might send to
a friend. Audio clips were captured using a smartphone on their
own in a quiet environment where participants were asked to speak
naturally. The median utterance length was 6 words.
All audio clips were manually transcribed with both the articulated
 phrase with dysfuencies (e.g.,  wh-(at) wh-(at) what is [...] the
weather  and the phrase that annotators believed the participant
intended to say (e.g.,  what is the weather ). For each phrase, one
human transcriber created an initial transcript and a second person
reviewed the transcript  additionally, a random 15% of transcripts
were spot checked by a third independent reviewer for quality control
 and were redone if needed. For the 41 2, which has a larger percentage of those with moderate or severe
dysfuency rates, the transcripts were annotated with detailed dysfuency
 labels. Specifcally, for each phrase, an annotator segmented
each dysfuency event by marking the start and end frames, and
added one of the following fve dysfuency labels  part-word repetition
 (e.g.,  ha- ha- ha- happy ), whole word repetition (e.g.,  I I
I ), sound prolongation ( wasss ), blocks (audible and inaudible),
and interjections (e.g.,  uh ,  um ). These annotations also went
through a similar QA process where dysfuencies with incorrect
timestamps or labels were marked as wrong.
Across all clips with dysfuency annotations, 58.6% of utterances
contain one or more part-word repetitions, 5.5% contain one or
more whole word repetitions, 36.4% prolongations, 38.7% blocks
and 2.8% interjections. Interjections were very common with one
participant but less prevalent more broadly. The rarity of interjections
 may be due to the short utterance lengths. In general, the
4A&H severities were computed using the same process as with the speech survey.

24 121 VA commands. Enabling People Who Stuter to Beter Use Speech Recognition CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany
distribution of dysfuency types varies greatly on a per-participant
basis. Some individuals frequently block but have few repetitions
whereas others have frequent repetitions but few blocks. We look
more at connections between dysfuencies and WER throughout
our speech recognition experiments.
4.2 Speech Recognition Results
In this section we present baseline performance for both endpointer
and ASR models on our dataset, as well as results from the three
interventions that address issues that arose in the survey  (1) endpointer
 tuning to address the problem of being frequently cut of by
VAs, (2) ASR decoder tuning to improve the ability to understand
stuttered speech, and (3) refning dysfuencies in the transcribed
speech that is output from the ASR model to improve dictation experiences
 for PWS. We also place these fndings in historical context
by investigating how ASR performance on speech from PWS has
changed over the past fve years, using archived consumer-grade
ASR models that were publicly available from 2017-2022.
The baseline models are from the Apple Speech framework [7],
which uses a hybrid deep neural network architecture for the ASR
system. See [38] for ASR model details, which at a glance is composed
 of an acoustic model, a language model, and a beam search
decoder. The acoustic model maps audio to phone- or word-like
intermediate representations, a language model encodes the probability
 of word sequences and acts as a prior over what words or
phrases someone may have said, and a beam search decoder that
efciently computes candidate transcriptions.
4.2.1 Endpointer Model Performance. An endpointer model identifes
 when the user stops speaking, and must balance the desire for
a low truncation rate (i.e., what percent of utterances are cut of too
early) with the desire for a minimal delay after speech (i.e., time
from the end of the utterance to when the VA stops listening). Our
base model is trained on completed utterances from the general
population, and predicts the end of a query using both auditory
cues like how long the user has been silent as well as ASR cues like
the chance a given word is the fnal word of an utterance. For each
input frame (time window), the model outputs the likelihood of
utterance completion. Once the output exceeds a defned threshold,
 the system stops listening and moves on to the next phase of
processing.
Baseline endpointer . The baseline likelihood threshold from the
model we used was set such that 97% of utterances from the general
population data are endpointed correctly (i.e., truncation rate of
3%). When evaluated on our data from PWS, which is likely poorly
represented in general population data, a much higher portion of
data is truncated early. Across the 41 2 participants,6 23.8% of utterances
( 19.7,   16.8,  29.0)  see Figure 4(a). Truncation rates
also vary substantially per person for 7 41 50%
of utterances are cut of early. This high truncation rate refects
the survey fndings, where a majority of participants reported that
early truncation was a key issue.

2 participants (N 41). In both cases, the tuned models are

each box, whereas the solid internal line is the median. (a)
Truncation rates are substantially lower than the baseline for
all tuned thresholds, and the moderate threshold results in a
rate of less than the 3% targeted for the general population.
(b) For WER, the ASR decoder tuning and the dysfuency
refnements signifcantly improve performance compared
to the baseline, and the combination of the two results in a
further signifcant improvement.
Our hypothesis, based on the literature and understanding of
stuttering, is that blocks, which are often expressed as inaudible
gasps, cause most endpointing errors. We validated this using the
dysfuency annotations by computed Spearman s rank correlation7
and found truncation rates are signifcantly positively correlated
with rates of blocks ( (39)   .64,    .001), part-word repetitions
( (39)   .44,    .004), and interjections ( (39)   .48,    .002). Correlations
 with prolongations ( (39)   .17,    .301) and whole word
repetitions (  (39)   .18,    .271) are not statistically signifcant.
7Spearman s rank correlation is used to correlate variables that are not distributed by
a Gaussian distribution such as our data that is highly skewed. CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Lea et al.
Tuned endpointer threshold (Intervention #1). To improve the VA
experience for PWS, we investigate performance of three new
thresholds that could reduce truncations for people with diferent
 rates of dysfuent speech. Specifcally, using the Phase 1 data,
we compute three new, higher threshold values that target an average
 3% truncation rate for participants with diferent levels of A&H
severities  a mild threshold based on the 25 1 participants
with mild ratings, a moderate threshold based on the 18 moderate
participants, and a severe threshold based on the 7 severe participants.
 By defnition, increasing the threshold will always reduce
or at worst maintain the same truncation rate as a lower threshold,
at the cost of incurring a longer delay before the system responds.
We evaluate these thresholds on the Phase 2 participant data.
As shown in Figure 4(a), the new thresholds substantially reduce
the truncation rate for PWS compared to the baseline. Even the
smallest threshold increase,  mild , reduces the truncation rate to
a per-participant average of 4.8% ( 6.4,   1.5,  6.5),
while the moderate threshold achieves our goal of under 3% on
average ( 2.5%,  3.6,   0.8,  3.1). Table 2 2 utterances and includes
metrics to capture how much delay occurs after the user fnishes
speaking. Here, 50 95 50th (median) and 95th
percentile delay between when a speech utterance ends and when
the system stops listening. This analysis shows that the improvements
 in truncation rate come with a modest median delay of an
additional 1.2 1.7
second increase in the moderate case. While the severe threshold is
successful for 99.2% of utterances, it causes a median delay of over
3 seconds. We return to these tradeofs in the Discussion.
4.2.2 Baseline & Improved ASR Model Performance. Next, we evaluated
 baseline ASR performance and compared the results to an
approach that tunes the ASR decoder using dysfuent speech. For
this analysis, we use the Apple Speech framework [7] and report
on results from an ASR model trained on voice assistant tasks and
speech from the general population. For completeness, we also
examined baseline performance with a model trained on dictation
tasks  the pattern of results was similar and thus results are omitted
for clarity.
Our primary evaluation metric is Word Error Rate (WER), as
widely used within the speech recognition community. Word Error
Rate is computed by counting the number of substitutions, insertions,
 and deletions in the transcribed text, and dividing by the
total number of intended words. For example, the intended phrase
 Add apples to my grocery list  may be spoken  A-(dd) a-(dd) add
apples to my grocery list  and be recognized as  had had balls
to my grocery list . With two insertions and one misrecognized
words, the WER is 50.0%.8 For some experiments, we also look at
Thresholded WER, as used in work by Project Euphonia [33, 65],
to assess VA performance for people with speech disabilities. This
8We report WER by frst calculating each participant s individual WER, then computing
averages across participants. This approach is common in the HCI community because
it provides an understanding of the distribution of how individual users may experience
the system. In contrast, the speech community often reports WER across an entire
dataset without grouping by participant. Thus, for completeness and in line with
the speech community s reporting, the baseline WER for all 91 19.9%  for only Phase 2, all data combined yields baseline WER of 25.4%.
These numbers end up being close to the averaged WERs presumably due to similar
number of phrases that each participant recorded. is computed as the percentage of utterances, per person, with WER
below 10% or 15% (as specifed). These values have been suggested
as potential minimums for VAs to be useful depending on domain.
Lastly, we look at Intent Error Rate (IER), which captures whether
the VA carries out the correct action in response to an utterance.
To compute Intent Error Rate, we run the ASR output on the NLU
model from Chen et al. [16] which also relied on models used by
the Apple Speech Framework. 9
Baseline ASR. Table 3 shows baseline ASR performance. Across
participants in both phases, the average baseline WER is 19.8%,
which is much higher than the  5% reported for consumer VA
systems [62, 68, 69]. The WER distribution is also highly skewed,
with many participants having low WERs but also a long tail of
participants with much higher WERs. For people with mild A&H
severity, the average WER was 4.8%, which is similar to what is
expected for people who do not stutter, whereas moderate and
severe had average WERs of 13.6% and 49.2%, respectively. Moreover,
 84.0% of participants with mild severity had a WER of less
than 10% (i.e., Thresholded WER) and the average Intent Error Rate
for this group was 4.9%, suggesting that many people with mild
A&H severity ratings would likely be able to use of-the-shelf VA
systems, which echos the VA usage reported in survey presented in
Figure 3(left).For moderate and severity grades, Intent Error Rates
are 7.3% and 18.4% respectively. Overall, this analysis both confrms
the ASR accuracy difculties described in the survey, as well as
refects the varied experiences that survey participants reported in
how well VAs understood them (Figure 2).
To understand how diferent types of dysfuencies afect WER,
we examined the Phase 2 data, which includes detailed dysfuency
annotations (see Section 4.1 for rates of each dysfuency type). Note
that Phase 2 only included participants with moderate and severe
A&H ratings, so on average has somewhat higher WER (25.4%)
than the full set of participants (bottom row of Table 3). For these
Phase 2 participants, we found high Spearman s rank correlations7
between WER and part-word repetitions ( (39)   .85,    .001) and
between WER and whole word repetitions ( (39)   .60,    .001).
The correlations were not signifcant for prolongations ( (39)   .3,
   .056), blocks ( (39)   .21,    .181) or interjections ( (39)   .15,
   .347). This indicates that part-word and whole word repetitions
tend to increase word error rates, and that blocks, prolongations
and interjections have less of an impact even if they are frequent.
Among all errors the ASR system made in Phase 2, 80.9% were
word insertions, 17.5% substitutions, and only 1.6% deletions. The
high rate of word insertions has a strong correlation with part-word
repetitions ( (39)   .73,    .001) followed by whole word repetitions
 ( (39)   .60,    .001). This echoes survey reports that partword
 or whole word repetition can lead to misrecognized words
being inserted in their transcription. A trained speech-language
pathologist characterized insertion errors from part-word repetitions
 and found that in many cases insertions come from individual
9While intent recognition is not the fnal response of the VA, it approximates what
action would be performed and can be treated as an upper bound on command
accuracy. Recall that intents are used by VAs and encode the grammar of the VA
command. For example, the query  What day is Christmas   may have the intent
structure clock[clockDate   clockNoun(date)   clockVerb( fnddate )] where date is
Christmas and fnddate is an action. The VA would then execute and return the date

syllables being recognized as whole words (e.g., the frst syllable in
 become , vocalized as  be-(come) be-(come) become ). In contrast,
a sound repetition on /b/ in  become  is less likely to lead to word
insertions. Furthermore, some people demonstrated part-word repetitions
 between syllables in multi-syllabic words, such as the word
 vocabulary  may result in spurious insertions, such as  vocab cab
Cavaleri. 
ASR Decoder Tuning (Intervention #2). Consumer ASR systems
are commonly trained on thousands of hours of speech from the
general public  an amount far larger than can likely be obtained
from PWS. However, an initial investigation by Mitra et al. [51] on
18 PWS has shown it may be possible to tune a small number of ASR
decoder parameters to improve performance for PWS. Here, we
validate this approach on our larger dataset and fnd even greater
gains when tuning on our 50 1 subset. While we
defer to that paper for details, in brief the approach increases the
importance of the language model relative to the acoustic component
 in the decoder and increases the penalty for word insertions.
These changes reduce the likelihood of predicting extraneous lowconfdence
 words often caused by part-word repetitions and bias
the model towards more likely voice assistant queries. We used
Phase 1 2.
The average WER for Phase 2 25.4% to 12.4% ( 12.3,   6.1,  13.1) with the
tuned decoder, which is a relative improvement of 51.2%. A Wilcoxon
signed rank test shows that this improvement is statistically significant.
 See Table 4 for more metrics and to understand how WER
improves as a function of dysfuency types. For example, the WER
lowers (improves) in 43.2% of utterances with part-word repetitions and increases (worsens) 3.9% of the time. For ASR tuning, WER
improves the most in utterances that have whole word repetitions,
part-word repetitions, and interjections and least for those with
prolongations or blocks.
4.2.3 Dysfluency Refinement (Intervention #3). According to our
survey, PWS are often displeased when seeing repeated words,
phrases and fller words in their dictated notes and texts. To address
 this issue, we refne the transcribed text using two strategies.
First, we look at fller words such as  um,   eh,   ah,   uh  and minor
variations. Many of these flters are not explicitly defned in the
language model (i.e., by design  eh  is never predicted), however, in
practice, short fllers are frequently transcribed as the word  oh.  As
part of our approach, we remove  oh  from predictions, unless  oh 
is used to represent the number zero. We considered others such as
 like  and  you know,  which are common in conversational speech,
but they did not appear as fllers in our dataset, likely because the
utterances tend to be short and more defned than free-form speech.
Second, we remove repeated words and phrases. This is more challenging
 because words may naturally be repeated (e.g.,  We had
had many discussions ). In our refnement approach, we take all
adjacent repeated words or phrases in a transcript and compute the
statistical likelihood that they would appear consecutively in text
using an n-gram language model that is similar to [34]. If the probability
 is below a threshold,10 i.e., P(substring 1, substring 2)   ,
then we remove the duplicate. Note that these two strategies 
interjection removal and repetition removal can be applied to any
ASR model output, thus we evaluated our dysfuency refnement
10 1 and non PWScentered
 datasets. CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Lea et al.

approach in combination with both ASR models from Section 4.2.2 
the baseline model and the model with the tuned decoder.
As shown in Figure 4(b), dysfuency refnement reduces WER
for the Phase 2 data compared to both the baseline and tuned ASR
models. The average WER goes from a baseline of 25.4% to 18.1%
( 19.2,   6.1,  22.8) after dysfuency refnement a
28.7% relative improvement on average. This improvement is significant
 with a Wilcoxon signed rank test (  839,   5.43,  .001). As
shown in Table 4, across the entire Phase 2 dataset, 64.7% of utterances
 that contain whole word repetitions see a WER improvement
and only 0.3% regress. For those with interjections, WER improves
in 30.9% and regresses in none of the utterances.
Applying dysfuency refnement to the output from the tuned
ASR model further reduces WER, from on average 12.5% with the
tuned model alone to 9.9% ( 8.8,   5.3,  10.3) for the
tuned model plus dysfuency refnement. Compared to the baseline
ASR model, this tuned model plus dysfuency refnement combination
 is an average 61.2% improvement across participants. Wilcoxon
signed rank tests show that these improvements are statistically
signifcant both when appended to the baseline ASR model output
(  741,  5.37,  .001) or appended to the tuned ASR model output
 (  595,   5.08,  .001). The percentage of participants with
WER  10% increases from 48.8% to 65.9% and the average Intent
Error Rate improved from 10.4% ( 10.8,   5.3,  13.4)
to 5.4% ( 5.8,   3.1,  7.2). Such improvements may
enable a VA to be usable for many of our participants when the
baseline is not  for example, P2-21 40.4%
(baseline) to 13.0% (tuned ASR   dysfuency refnements) and IER
improves from 19.1% (baseline) to 4.6%.
4.2.4 ASR Results Over Time. The above analyses assess the efectiveness
 of three changes to an existing speech recognition system
that require little data from PWS to implement. At the same time,
there has been substantial progress in general speech recognition
models in recent years, with some accounts claiming WERs of 5%
or less using consumer voice assistants [69]. Theoretically, these
general improvements could also result in improvements for PWS.
To understand how these changes over time impact performance
on dysfuent speech, we use the Apple Speech framework to run
all Phase 1 2 2017 2022 2022. Figure 5 6 months across the fve years.
The utterance-weighted WER was 29.5% for the Fall 2017 model,
Figure 5 2017 2022. There is a
signifcant improvement in part- and whole word repetitions.
Note that absolute WERs and their improvements may not
be representative of performance on other sub-populations
in the general public, which has been documented to be as
low as 5% WER (e.g., [69]).
fell consistently for the following eight time periods, and ended at
19.9%. This is a 32.5% relative reduction in WER from the start to
the end of the 5-year time span. Diferences at each time point may
be attributed to what data was used in training, the convolutional
architecture, and/or the language model.
For Phase 2 utterances, we further examined changes in how specifc
 types of dysfuencies manifest in WER performance between
the Fall 2017 2022 models. For part-word repetitions,
the WER improved 43.5% of utterances (worse 12.2%), those with
whole word repetitions 46.8% (worse 14.5%), prolongations 36.9%
(worse 10.3%), blocks 36.0% (worse 9.4%), and interjections 65.8%
(worse 10.4%). The improvements with part-word repetitions are
especially interesting, because these errors are more challenging
to correct using our strategies. See the Discussion (Section 5) for
further implications of these fndings.
4.3 Summary
This performance analysis mirrors the primary concerns raised
by survey participants and identifes promising directions for improving
 speech recognition performance for PWS. With baseline
production-grade models, data from PWS resulted in high truncation
 rates (23.8%), often due to blocks, as well as high WER rates
(19.8%), which were dominated by insertion errors. Correlating
these errors with dysfuency annotations highlighted how diferent
stuttering characteristics can impact diferent types of errors. Fortunately,
 the three interventions investigated ofer improvements Enabling People Who Stuter to Beter Use Speech Recognition CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany
for PWS, and can be implemented with limited data and changes
to an ASR system. By tuning the endpointer detection threshold
on data from PWS, truncation rates on Phase 2 79.1% ( mild ) with minor additional system delay
of 1.2 seconds. Both ASR decoder tuning and dysfuency refnement
improve WER compared to the baseline ASR model transcriptions,
and combining the two ofers a further reduction in WER (relative
drop of 61.2% compared to the baseline ASR model alone for Phase
2 data).
5 DISCUSSION
Our fndings demonstrate the contrasting experiences that PWS
encounter with speech technologies, and an overall strong interest
in improved speech input accessibility from most survey participants.
 Of-the-shelf VAs and dictation work reasonably well for
many people with mild stuttering severity. The survey shows that
many PWS use speech recognition regularly (32.2% daily), albeit
at a lower rate compared to the general population [53]. Moreover,
the performance analysis shows that most (84.0%) participants with
mild stuttering severity had word error rates of less than 10%, a
suggested threshold below which VAs can become usable [33].
At the same time, participants with more moderate to severe
speech dysfuencies often encountered serious technical barriers
to adoption. Being cut of too early (with VAs) and ASR accuracy
(both VAs and dictation) were primary technical concerns refected
in both the survey and baseline speech analysis  for the Phase 2
participants, truncation rates were substantially higher than the
targeted general population rate (23.8% vs. 3%) and average word
error rate was 25.4%. We investigated three promising interventions
(two new and one previously introduced) to address these issues 
(1) tuning the endpointer threshold on moderate dysfuent speech
reduces truncations for PWS to below the target of 3%, (2) tuning
the ASR decoder (approach from [51]) signifcantly reduces word
error rate, and (3) applying dysfuency refnements to the ASR
output further signifcantly reduces word error rate regardless of
whether we are using the baseline ASR model or the tuned ASR
model. Also of importance, however, our survey highlights that
regardless of how well speech technology works, some PWS will
still not be interested in it due to perceptions of utility, the physical
efort required to speak, and not wanting to use speech input around
other people.
Overall, this work is the frst to quantify user experiences for
PWS, connect those experiences to performance across a range of
stuttering severities, and propose and show the impact of multiple
technical improvements to support PWS in using speech technology.
 We refect on these fndings and potential future research in
technical improvements for dysfuent speech and in the design and
user experience of such systems. We also cover limitations of the
work.
5.1 Technical Improvements for Dysfuent
Speech
Our approach has been to identify technical improvements that
integrate with rather than replace existing systems, by ofering
relatively small adaptations to the speech recognition pipeline 
changing an endpointer threshold, tuning the ASR s decoder model, and inserting a post-processing step to refne dysfuencies. Moreover,
 the techniques require very little data compared to what would
be needed to train endpointer and ASR models from scratch, and
are thus in contrast to many recent papers that replace existing
systems with large ASR models trained on dysfuent speech (e.g.,
[2, 50, 61]) or personalized ASR models that require large amounts
of data from a specifc person (e.g., [33] which requires 15 - 120
minutes of speech).
As shown in Section 4.2.4, general ASR improvements do improve
 performance for PWS, but a substantial gap remains between
current and desired performance. While this gap may continue
to narrow over time, concerns unique to PWS will likely persist.
For example, multiple respondents, unprompted, highlighted how
word repetitions and interjections in their transcriptions lead to
 errors  and can result in increased stress or emotional response.
General ASR modeling innovations typically transcribe verbatim,
thus including these unintended words. As such, human-centered
ASR approaches like ours are likely necessary for improving the
overall speech recognition experience for PWS.
The techniques we investigated, while promising, also come with
tradeofs that beneft some users but may degrade performance for
others. For example, a user who frequently experiences blocks may
be happy to increase a VA system s delay in responding if it means
that they will be able to use the system more efectively, whereas
someone who rarely blocks may be annoyed by the slower response
time. While ideally a single ASR system could apply to all users,
one short-term approach is to ofer individuals an option to opt-in
to specifc settings that may beneft them. In this case, allowing
users to choose between a small set of endpointer options may be
useful.
For ASR decoder tuning, tradeofs may exist between improved
recognition of dysfuent words (e.g., due to part-word repetitions)
and a possibly increased error rate for rarer words due to the higher
language model weight. And, for dysfuency refnement, the system
 could inadvertently eliminate some words that appear to be
dysfuencies but were intentional on the user s part (e.g., removing
the duplicate  so  in  I am so so happy ). In the short-term, ASR
decorder tuning and dysfuency refnement could also be enabled
as opt-in features, though future work should investigate how to
seamlessly integrate them into general ASR systems. For example,
an improved dysfuency refnement approach could learn to distinguish
 dysfuent from intended repetitions, handle partial word
repetitions in addition to whole word repetitions and interjections,
and even learn fller word patterns unique to a given person.
We focused on endpointing and ASR solutions, but two additional
 technical concerns that arose with less frequency in the survey
 data are wake words (e.g.,  Alexa ,  Hey Siri ) and automatic
punctuation. Ofering multiple wake word alternatives, custom
wake words, or fexibility in the pause length between words so
as to accommodate blocks could improve accessibility for these
users. For automatic punctuation, multiple respondents mentioned
punctuation being inserted incorrectly during pauses in speech.
Efort should be made to understand how blocks and pauses impact
 current punctuation models and if there are ways to avoid
incorrectly inserted punctuation. CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Lea et al.
5.2 Additional Design and User Experience
Considerations
A key next step will be to validate our speech experiments by incorporating
 the three technical improvements into a fully interactive
system to evaluate with PWS. Such an evaluation will allow us to understand
 the extent to which the ofine experiments here translate
to impacts on user experience and satisfaction with speech input 
fully closing the loop with the subjective experiences reported in
the survey. Understanding how users feel about the tradeofs described
 above (e.g., truncation rate vs. response delay) and what
dysfuencies they want to have refned in their transcribed speech
will be important. Preferences may vary greatly across individuals,
 for example, with some not wanting the system to  fx  their
transcribed speech.
In addition to the above model-side improvements for PWS,
there is potential for some challenges to be addressed through more
interactive approaches. One possibility is for users to provide feedback
 directly to the system, training it to better support their own
stuttering patterns and to accommodate their desire for diferent
types of refnements. For dictation and screen-based VAs, this type
of feedback could occur by displaying the transcribed speech and
allowing the user to manipulate it through direct touch to indicate
error words that should be removed or corrected [10]. Perhaps the
frst time a pattern is encountered, such as a suspected full or partial
repetition of a specifc word or a transcribed interjection from a
list of common interjections (e.g.,  um ,  like ), the system could
prompt the user to indicate that it should hide or repair future
similar dysfuencies from transcripts.
Correction feedback on screen-free voice assistant devices is
more difcult, because the user may not see what words were
predicted  they may only receive notifcation of what VA action
was performed. One possibility would be to learn how speakers
rephrase their command when the voice assistant suggests a wrong
action, which could be useful if an individual intentionally chooses
new words that they are less likely to stutter on. Some current
systems also allow users to review the recognized text on another
device (e.g., Alexa s smartphone app), and could potentially be
extended to allow users to correct the transcription. Any of these
forms of correction could ultimately be incorporated into the system
to personalize speech recognition.
The design of any speech interface for PWS will need to also
account for non-technical contextual factors around use. As demonstrated
 in survey responses, some PWS may fnd their ability or
desire to use speech technology will difer depending on whether
other people are around (some respondents did not want others to
hear them speak). Further, some participants reported that their
stuttering severity varied based on their history with the device,
for example, increasing following a negative interaction with the
device. Both of these scenarios emphasize the importance of supporting
 PWS in seamlessly transitioning from speech to text-based
input as needed, and ensuring that speech is never the only means
of accomplishing a task.
Emphasizing the utility of combining multiple modalities of input
for PWS, most survey participants (84.7%) used VAs on a smartphone,
 and some responses pointed to the accessibility benefts of
doing so. Speech afordances vary greatly on smartphones versus smart speakers, with smartphones ofering alternative invocation
mechanisms such as holding a physical button to speak or pushing
a virtual button on-screen. In addition, holding a button (e.g., on
iOS) can disable the endpointer, meaning a user will not be cut of
mid-utterance. These features are also available on some smartwatches,
 but not at-a-distance devices like smart speakers. Future
work should investigate alternatives that improve these experiences
on screen-free devices.
5.3 Beyond Fluency
While the primary focus of this paper is on stuttering, the interventions
 may improve speech recognition for people with other types of
communication disabilities. For example, endpointer improvements
may improve performance for people with hypokinetic dysarthria
that experience unpredictable silences (e.g., Parkinson s Disease)
or hyperkinetic dysarthria that experience intermittent aphonia or
voice stoppages in their speech (e.g., Tourette syndrome) [26]. These
improvements may also afect individuals with expressive aphasia
who take longer to come up with a target word [27]. Dysfuency
refnement could improve WER for individuals with spasmodic
dysphonia and hypokinetic dysarthia as they may produce part- or
whole word repetitions [30, 39]. People with spasmodic dysphonia
may present with an increase in interjections [14], which could be
removed with Dysfuency Refnement or ASR Tuning.
Other speech, voice, or language diferences not addressed by
this work include  breathy breaks mid-word that can cause word
insertions and substitutions (e.g., in cases of spasmodic dysphonia
[52]), distorted vowels which could result in word substitutions (e.g.,
in cases of ataxic and hyperkinetic dysarthria [26]), pitch breaks
(e.g., in cases of faccid dysarthria and some voice disorders [26]),
atypical rhythm and stress (e.g., in cases of faccid and hypokinetic
dysarthria [21]), speech characteristics that deteriorate or change
over time (e.g., in cases of Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), some
voice disorders, and some dysathrias), and vowel neutralization and
diferences in resonance (e.g, in cases of speech from Deaf/Hard of
Hearing individuals [63]).
5.4 Limitations and Potential Biases
Speech characteristics can vary with time and with settings, as
noted above and in the literature (e.g., [13, 64]), so our collected
audio data does not provide a full view of speech characteristics for
each participant. Recordings were done at an individual s convenience,
 while by themselves, which likely impacted the prevalence
and severity of dysfuencies. Some users may have had more dysfuencies
 because they knew they were being recorded, while others
may have had less because they could do it when they felt most
comfortable. One improvement on our methodology would be to
ask participants to record commands at diferent times of the day,
in diferent environments, and perhaps diferent situations where
their dysfuency patterns might be diferent. We also focused solely
on speech accessibility and did not ask participants if they had other
accessibility needs for computing devices which could impact the
efectiveness of some solutions like pushing a button to invoke a
voice assistant.
The fne-grained dysfuency annotations enabled detailed analysis
 of how rates vary per-person, however, there were two types of Enabling People Who Stuter to Beter Use Speech Recognition CHI  23, April 23 28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany
annotator errors that we estimate to have impacted a small percent
of clips. We found that some dysfuency types confated for oneanother.
 For example, some sound or part-word repetitions (e.g.,
 s-s-snake ) were confated with prolongations (e.g.,  ssssnake ) and
vice versa. This means that there may be discrepancies between
our reported dysfuency correlations and the actual correlations.
Second, with the transcript annotations, people were asked to label
both the articulated and the  intended  speech. Ideally, the intended
speech would have been verifed by participants  instead it was
labeled with an annotator s best guess based on context. In a small
percentage of clips we found likely discrepancies and in many cases
improved with an annotation refnement pass.
Quality of ASR results varies signifcantly as a function of uniqueness 
 common VA queries or dictation phrases may be more likely
to be accurately recognized and rare words or phrases are less likely.
This is even more the case with our ASR tuning approach, which
biases the language modeling priors over the acoustic information.
Given that the majority of the audio recording prompts were VArelated albeit
 with proper nouns such as musician names our
WER may be lower than what one might expect in the real-world,
especially for dictation which is more open ended. As emphasized
above, a key step for future work will be to evaluate the improvements
 proposed here with PWS using a fully interactive system.
The fndings in Section 4 are derived using an ASR system with a
hybrid architecture, specifcally with the Apple Speech Framework.
ASR systems trained with diferent data or architectures could exhibit
 diferent model biases, as seen in our analysis in Section 4.2.4,
where each model exhibited diferent performances and biases toward
 certain dysfuency types. Nonetheless, our general fndings
of poor WER performance for stuttered speech is congruent to similar
 WER analysis conducted on other ASR systems using diferent
architectures [2, 3, 61].
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we described survey fndings from 61 91person
 collection. We found that some PWS already use speech
recognition systems regularly, some state that they would never
be interested, but regardless of existing performance over half of
respondents would use speech technology more frequently if they
were more accurate. While our speech recognition results indicated
worse baseline performance relative to the general public, especially
 for people with higher rates of dysfuencies, our model tuning
and dysfuency refnement solutions can drastically reduce endpointing
 and ASR error rates, and ultimately enable  good enough 
(WER  15) performance for most users.
