What is the abstract of the paper 'A Study on the Integration of Pipeline and E2E SLU Systems for Spoken Semantic Parsing Toward Stop Quality Challenge'?,"Recently there have been efforts to introduce new benchmark tasks for spoken language understanding (SLU), like semantic parsing. In this paper, we describe our proposed spoken semantic parsing system for the quality track (Track 1) in Spoken Language Understanding Grand Challenge which is part of ICASSP Signal Processing Grand Challenge 2023. We experiment with both end-to-end and pipeline systems for this task. Strong automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Whisper and pretrained Language models (LM) like BART are utilized inside our SLU framework to boost performance. We also investigate the output level combination of various models to get an exact match accuracy of 80.8, which won the 1st place at the challenge.","##Author: Shinji Watanabe, ##Title: A Study on the Integration of Pipeline and E2E SLU Systems for Spoken Semantic Parsing Toward Stop Quality Challenge"
