"What is the abstract of the paper 'Methods for Measuring, Updating, and Visualizing Factual Beliefs in Language Models'?","Language models can memorize a considerable amount of factual information during pretraining that can be elicited through prompting or finetuning models on tasks like question answering. In this paper, we discuss approaches to measuring model factual beliefs, updating incorrect factual beliefs in models, and visualizing graphical relationships between factual beliefs. Our main contributions include: (1) new metrics for evaluating belief-updating methods focusing on the logical consistency of beliefs, (2) a training objective for Sequential, Local, and Generalizing updates (SLAG) that improves the performance of existing hypernetwork approaches, and (3) the introduction of the belief graph, a new form of visualization for language models that shows relationships between stored model beliefs. Our experiments suggest that models show only limited consistency between factual beliefs, but update methods can both fix incorrect model beliefs and greatly improve their consistency. Although off-the-shelf optimizers are surprisingly strong belief-updating baselines, our learned optimizers can outperform them in more difficult settings than have been considered in past work.","##Title: Methods for Measuring, Updating, and Visualizing Factual Beliefs in Language Models"
