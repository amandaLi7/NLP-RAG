What is the abstract of the paper 'Latent Phrase Matching for Dysarthric Speech'?,"Many consumer speech recognition systems are not tuned for people with speech disabilities, resulting in poor recognition and user experience, especially for severe speech differences. Recent studies have emphasized interest in personalized speech models from people with atypical speech patterns. We propose a query-by-example-based personalized phrase recognition system that is trained using small amounts of speech, is language agnostic, does not assume a traditional pronunciation lexicon, and generalizes well across speech difference severities. On an internal dataset collected from 32 people with dysarthria, this approach works regardless of severity and shows a 60% improvement in recall relative to a commercial speech recognition system. On the public EasyCall dataset of dysarthric speech, our approach improves accuracy by 30.5%. Performance degrades as the number of phrases increases, but consistently outperforms ASR systems when trained with 50 unique phrases.",##Title: Latent Phrase Matching for Dysarthric Speech
