What is the abstract of the paper 'Accelerating Diffusion-based Combinatorial Optimization Solvers by Progressive Distillation'?,"Graph-based diffusion models have shown promising results in terms of generating high-quality solutions to NP-complete (NPC) combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. However, those models are often inefficient in inference, due to the iterative evaluation nature of the denoising diffusion process. This paper proposes to use progressive distillation to speed up the inference by taking fewer steps (e.g., forecasting two steps ahead within a single step) during the denoising process. Our experimental results show that the progressively distilled model can perform inference 16 times faster with only 0.019% degradation in performance on the TSP-50 dataset.",##Title: Accelerating Diffusion-based Combinatorial Optimization Solvers by Progressive Distillation
