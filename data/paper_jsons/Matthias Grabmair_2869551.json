    "title": "Joint Span Segmentation and Rhetorical Role Labeling with Data Augmentation for Legal Documents",
    "abstract": "Segmentation and Rhetorical Role Labeling of legal judgements play a crucial role in retrieval and adjacent tasks, including case summarization, semantic search, argument mining etc. Previous approaches have formulated this task either as independent classification or sequence labeling of sentences. In this work, we reformulate the task at span level as identifying spans of multiple consecutive sentences that share the same rhetorical role label to be assigned via classification. We employ semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to jointly learn span segmentation and span label assignment. We further explore three data augmentation strategies to mitigate the data scarcity in the specialized domain of law where individual documents tend to be very long and annotation cost is high. Our experiments demonstrate improvement of span-level prediction metrics with a semi-Markov CRF model over a CRF baseline. This benefit is contingent on the presence of multi sentence spans in the document.",

    "title": "Zero-shot Transfer of Article-aware Legal Outcome Classification for European Court of Human Rights Cases",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we cast Legal Judgment Prediction on European Court of Human Rights cases into an article-aware classification task, where the case outcome is classified from a combined input of case facts and convention articles. This configuration facilitates the model learning some legal reasoning ability in mapping article text to specific case fact text. It also provides an opportunity to evaluate the model\u2019s ability to generalize to zero-shot settings when asked to classify the case outcome with respect to articles not seen during training. We devise zero-shot experiments and apply domain adaptation methods based on domain discrimination and Wasserstein distance. Our results demonstrate that the article-aware architecture outperforms straightforward fact classification. We also find that domain adaptation methods improve zero-shot transfer performance, with article relatedness and encoder pre-training influencing the effect.",

    "title": "Leveraging Task Dependency and Contrastive Learning for Case Outcome Classification on European Court of Human Rights Cases",
    "abstract": "We report on an experiment in case outcome classification on European Court of Human Rights cases where our model first learns to identify the convention articles allegedly violated by the state from case facts descriptions, and subsequently uses that information to classify whether the court finds a violation of those articles. We assess the dependency between these two tasks at the feature and outcome level. Furthermore, we leverage a hierarchical contrastive loss to pull together article-specific representations of cases at the higher level, leading to distinctive article clusters. The cases in each article cluster are further pulled closer based on their outcome, leading to sub-clusters of cases with similar outcomes. Our experiment results demonstrate that, given a static pre-trained encoder, our models produce a small but consistent improvement in classification performance over single-task and joint models without contrastive loss.",
