    "title": "Unsupervised Voice Type Discrimination Score Adaptation Using X-Vector Clusters",
    "abstract": "Voice type discrimination (VTD) is the task of automatically detecting speech produced in the same room as a recording device (\"live speech\") among other speech and non-speech noises, such as traffic noises or radio broadcasts (\"distractor audio\"). Existing work has described methods for performing the VTD task. This paper presents a method for adapting the output of these existing methods in an unsupervised manner via x-vector clustering and correlation. This adaptation method can be applied to the output of any VTD algorithm, requires no additional training data, and has been shown to yield a relative decrease in decision cost function (DCF) score of up to 47% on a standardized database collected for the task.",
