    "abstract": "Background\nWe discuss a free software system (Computerized Language Analysis [CLAN]) that can enable fast, thorough, and informative language sample analysis (LSA).\n\n\nMethod\nWe describe methods for eliciting, transcribing, analyzing, and interpreting language samples. Using a hypothetical child speaker, we illustrate use KidEval to generate a diagnostic report.\n\n\nResults\nGiven LSA results suggestive of expressive language delay, we analyze further using CLAN's Developmental Sentence Score and Index of Productive Syntax routines, and outline the child's use of Brown's morphemes.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis tutorial provides an introduction to the use of free CLAN software. We discuss how LSA results can be used to structure therapy goals that address specific aspects of grammatical structure that the child may not yet demonstrate in their spoken language. Finally, we provide answers to common questions, including user support.",

    "title": "Automation of Language Sample Analysis",
    "abstract": "Purpose: A major barrier to the wider use of language sample analysis (LSA) is the fact that transcription is very time intensive. Methods that can reduce the required time and effort could help in promoting the use of LSA for clinical practice and research. Method: This article describes an automated pipeline, called Batchalign, that takes raw audio and creates full transcripts in Codes for the Human Analysis of Talk (CHAT) transcription format, complete with utterance- and word-level time alignments and morphosyntactic analysis. The pipeline only requires major human intervention for final checking. It combines a series of existing tools with additional novel reformatting processes. The steps in the pipeline are (a) automatic speech recognition, (b) utterance tokenization, (c) automatic corrections, (d) speaker ID assignment, (e) forced alignment, (f) user adjustments, and (g) automatic morphosyntactic and profiling analyses. Results: For work with recordings from adults with language disorders, six major results were obtained: (a) The word error rate was between 2.4% for controls and 3.4% for patients, (b) utterance tokenization accuracy was at the level reported for speakers without language disorders, (c) word-level diarization accuracy was at 93% for control participants and 83% for participants with language disorders, (d) utterance-level diarization accuracy based on word-level diarization was high, (e) adherence to CHAT format was fully accurate, and (f) human transcriber time was reduced by up to 75%. Conclusion: The pipeline dramatically shortens the time gap between data collection and data analysis and provides an output superior to that typically generated by human transcribers.",

    "abstract": "Aphasia is a language disorder that affects the speaking ability of millions of patients. This paper presents a new benchmark for Aphasia speech recognition and detection tasks using state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques with the AphsiaBank dataset. Specifically, we introduce two multi-task learning methods based on the CTC/Attention architecture to perform both tasks simultaneously. Our system achieves state-of-the-art speaker-level detection accuracy (97.3%), and a relative WER reduction of 11% for moderate Aphasia patients. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by applying it to another disordered speech database, the DementiaBank Pitt corpus. We will make our all-in-one recipes and pre-trained model publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. Our standardized data preprocessing pipeline and open-source recipes enable researchers to compare results directly, promoting progress in disordered speech processing.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe goal of the Collaborative Commentary (CC) system is to make the TalkBank adult clinical databases-including AphasiaBank, DementiaBank, RHDBank, and TBIBank-open to commentary and analysis from the full community of researchers, instructors, students, and clinicians.\n\n\nMETHOD\nCC allows a group leader to establish a commentary group and invite colleagues or students to join as members of the group. Members can then browse through the transcript database using the TalkBank Browser. When they wish to insert a comment, they click on the utterance line number or drag the cursor across a range of utterances and a window opens to receive the comment. The comment can include open text along with codes selected from a predefined set of codes created by that commentary group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCC was released for public use in August 2022. It is being used currently in five research projects and eight classes. An important feature of CC is its ability to evaluate the reliability of coding systems and to sharpen analytic categories. By familiarizing instructors and researchers with the capabilities of CC, we expect to see an increasing usage of CC for a variety of clinical and research applications.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCC can contribute to a better understanding of connected speech features in aphasia, dementia, right hemisphere disorder, and traumatic brain injury. CC represents an extreme innovation not only for the study of adult neurogenic communication disorders but also for the study of spoken language generally.",

    "title": "Evaluating Picture Description Speech for Dementia Detection using Image-text Alignment",
    "abstract": "Using picture description speech for dementia detection has been studied for 30 years. Despite the long history, previous models focus on identifying the differences in speech patterns between healthy subjects and patients with dementia but do not utilize the picture information directly. In this paper, we propose the first dementia detection models that take both the picture and the description texts as inputs and incorporate knowledge from large pre-trained image-text alignment models. We observe the difference between dementia and healthy samples in terms of the text's relevance to the picture and the focused area of the picture. We thus consider such a difference could be used to enhance dementia detection accuracy. Specifically, we use the text's relevance to the picture to rank and filter the sentences of the samples. We also identified focused areas of the picture as topics and categorized the sentences according to the focused areas. We propose three advanced models that pre-processed the samples based on their relevance to the picture, sub-image, and focused areas. The evaluation results show that our advanced models, with knowledge of the picture and large image-text alignment models, achieve state-of-the-art performance with the best detection accuracy at 83.44%, which is higher than the text-only baseline model at 79.91%. Lastly, we visualize the sample and picture results to explain the advantages of our models.",

    "title": "Multilingual Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech: A Signal Processing Grand Challenge",
    "abstract": "This Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC) targets a difficult automatic prediction problem of societal and medical relevance, namely, the detection of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia (AD). Participants were invited to employ signal processing and machine learning methods to create predictive models based on spontaneous speech data. The Challenge has been designed to assess the extent to which predictive models built based on speech in one language (English) generalise to another language (Greek). To the best of our knowledge no work has investigated acoustic features of the speech signal in multilingual AD detection. Our baseline system used conventional machine learning algorithms with Active Data Representation of acoustic features, achieving accuracy of 73.91% on AD detection, and 4.95 root mean squared error on cognitive score prediction.",

    "title": "DementiaBank: Theoretical Rationale, Protocol, and Illustrative Analyses",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Dementia from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized primarily by a significant decline in memory abilities; however, language abilities are also commonly affected and may precede the decline of other cognitive abilities. To study the progression of language, there is a need for open-access databases that can be used to build algorithms to produce translational models sensitive enough to detect early declines in language abilities. DementiaBank is an open-access repository of transcribed video/audio data from communicative interactions from people with dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls. The aims of this tutorial are to (a) describe the newly established standardized DementiaBank discourse protocol, (b) describe the Delaware corpus data, and (c) provide examples of automated linguistic analyses that can be conducted with the Delaware corpus data and describe additional DementiaBank resources. Method: The DementiaBank discourse protocol elicits four types of discourse: picture description, story narrative, procedural, and personal narrative. The Delaware corpus currently includes data from 20 neurotypical adults and 33 adults with MCI from possible AD who completed the DementiaBank discourse protocol and a cognitive\u2013linguistic battery. Language samples were video- and audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and uploaded to DementiaBank. The protocol materials and transcription programs can be accessed for free via the DementiaBank website. Results: Illustrative analyses show the potential of the Delaware corpus data to help understand discourse metrics at the individual and group levels. In addition, they highlight analyses that could be used across TalkBank's other clinical banks (e.g., AphasiaBank). Information is also included on manual and automatic speech recognition transcription methods. Conclusions: DementiaBank is a shared online database that can facilitate research efforts to address the gaps in knowledge about language changes associated with MCI and dementia from AD. Identifying early language markers could lead to improved assessment and treatment approaches for adults at risk for dementia.",
