Notes 
*Students taking courses in Heinz College and Tepper School of Business (MBA and
Computational Finance programs) must review and follow separate academic calendars 
Similarly, students taking doctoral courses must review and follow the doctoral calendar for those courses.
1Students dropping a course while remaining enrolled (in at least one course-section) will
receive a tuition adjustment only if they drop by this date. Students taking a Leave of Absence
or Withdrawing from the university should consult the official Tuition Adjustment Policy.
2Not applicable for graduate students in CFA, DC & SCS. Only graduate students in CIT, HC,
MCS & TSB students receive W grades for course withdrawal.
3Course withdrawal is not an option after this date for students taking undergraduate or
masters course-sections. Students must decide if they wish to use their course drop voucher, and should discuss their options with their academic advisor in advance of these dates. -- Students taking course-sections designated as doctoral courses are exempt from this restriction ONLY IN THOSE designated course-sections.
4Advisor approval is required for vouchers to be initiated. It is strongly recommended that you
contact your advisor prior to the posted deadline to discuss options.
 -- Please contact your advisor before 12 noon on the deadline date.
 -- Doctoral students do not receive vouchers.
**Regarding Grade Due dates, please note that fall & spring mid-semester as well as mini-1 & 3
grades are due the Monday after break instead of during break in both fall and spring. This
confirms to a  desire for a single due date, and with mini finals on Saturday, it provides
additional time for grading.
***Summer Session All corresponds to Summer Semester Dates. Summer Session One and
Summer Session Two correspond to Summer One & Mini-5and Summer Two & Mini-6 dates
& deadlines, respectively.
****Summer Session All, One and Two Final Exams will be scheduled by the University Registrar's Office.
