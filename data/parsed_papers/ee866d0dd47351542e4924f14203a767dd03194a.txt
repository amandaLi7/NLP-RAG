Abstract
Persian poetry has profoundly affected all periods of Persian literature and the literature
of other countries as well. It is a fundamental vehicle for expressing Persian cultureand political opinion. This paper presents a corpus of Persian literary text mainly
focusing on poetry, covering the ninth to twenty-ﬁrst century annotated for century
and style, with additional partial annotation of rhetorical ﬁgures. Our resource is the
largest and the most diverse corpus available in Persian literary text, with a particularly
broad temporal scope. This allows us to conduct several computational experiments toanalyze poetic styles, authors and time periods, as well as context shifts over time, for
which we rely both on supervised models and on Persian poetry-speciﬁc heuristics.
The corpus, the tools, and experiments described in this paper can be used not onlyfor digital humanities studies of Persian literature but also for processing Persian texts
in general, as well as in other broader cross-linguistic applications.

1 Introduction
1.1 Motivation
Compiling corpora for low-resource languages is a valuable undertaking for preser-
vation, education, knowledge acquisition, and monitoring demographic and politicalprocesses. The focus of this work is on presenting a large machine-readable corpus
of Persian literary text suitable for studying a variety of NLP problems in Persian,
including lexical semantics, authorship prediction, style classiﬁcation, and compu-tational approaches for studying rhetorical ﬁgures and metaphor. Further, since the
corpus covers the majority of available Persian poems across over fourteenth cen-
turies, the corpus facilitates computational studies to track meaning shifts over time.
Poetry explores the space of imagination beyond linguistic interpretation and prag-
matics (Kadkani, 1943 ; Atashi, 2004 ), yet brings distinctive insights (Hobbs, 1990 ).
Persian poetry, in particular, has not only played a profound role in shaping Per-
sian culture, politics, and literature, but has a pervasive inﬂuence on world literature
(Mohaqeqi et al., 2014 ;T u s i , 2013 ). Even in the United States, Rumi ,Khayyam , and
Hafez are among the best-selling poets.
1.2 Previous work
While there has been substantial computational research on poetry in English (Lau et
al.,2018 ; Greene et al., 2010 ; Genzel et al., 2010 ; Hayward, 1996 ), Chinese (Zhang
et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2019 ), and German (Baumann et al., 2018 ), among others,
Persian poetry has not been widely studied in computational linguistics. The works
that do exist point to the need for more comprehensive and systematic resources: Forinstance, Asgari and Chappelier ( 2013 ), Asgari et al. ( 2013 ) apply topic modeling to
Persian poetry but work with a collection of works by 30 poets but only in one style,
Ghazal . The corpus presented here covers those datasets as well as other styles. Other
studies (Malmasi & Dras, 2015 ; Seraji et al., 2012 ; Khashabi et al., 2021 ) focus solely
on contemporary Farsi language.
1.3 Contributions
We introduce a corpus of Persian literary text that encompasses poems from the ninth
to twenty-ﬁrst centuries as well as the two main collections of myths and stories
Gulistan andPanchatantra . Gulistan Saadi includes a mix of poetry and prose. These
collections are essential for designing basic models for processing literary text, suchas spell checkers and temporal and structural analyses. Table 1provides essential
statistics on the corpus.
In addition, in order to study the symbolism and rhetorical ﬁgures in Persian, we
annotate 4192 lines of poetry with six rhetorical ﬁgures. We explain these ﬁgures and
their similarities to their English counterparts. We present detailed statistics about
the corpus, and, in a series of computational experiments, we introduce a baseline

bNumber of lines are only counted for poetry
for classifying authors and styles. Finally, we present a study on semantic shifts in
different eras of Persian poetry.
While our experiments focus on poetry, some collections consist of a mix of prose
and poetry, and keeping only the poetry would lead to incomplete collections. Thus,
including prose is useful for completeness and may be beneﬁcial for certain kinds of
temporal and structural analyses. Also, we made deliberate choices in selecting themost prominent styles and poets for the classiﬁcation experiments. Our criteria are
based on factors such as popularity, as well as differences in content and intent among
the selected poets. By taking this approach, we aim to present a balanced representationthat can be applicable to cross-linguistic studies while avoiding excessive information
speciﬁc to Persian poetry.
1.4 Outline
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we explain the data collection
and normalization process used to compile a clean, well-organized corpus of Persian
literary text from the ninth to twenty-ﬁrst century. In Sect. 3, we describe the human
annotation process used to endow our corpus with annotations for century, style,author, and a rich set of rhetorical ﬁgures. To demonstrate the merits of the corpus,
in Sect. 4, we present a series of computational analyses that offer new techniques
to investigate literary developments over time and present an open-source library forstyle classiﬁcation. Additionally, we describe a series of classiﬁcation experiments to
show the distinction between the authors and different periods.
2 Corpus compilation
We had to overcome several challenges to make this corpus possible. The ﬁrst of these
is the limited availability of relevant source texts on the web. To complete some of
123S. Raji et al.
the collections and annotations, we had to obtain access to a diverse set of resources.
Second, cleaning and normalizing online text in Farsi requires correcting for various
keyboard layouts, including Arabic. We release Python code with this submission forcleaning and normalizing diverse forms of Persian text,
1as most existing libraries are
designed only for modern text. Third, annotating literary text is expensive and requires
expert annotators. We have annotated part of the corpus with key rhetorical ﬁguressuch as metaphor with high reliability following carefully designed protocols.
2.1 Crawling
To compile a comprehensive corpus with poems and stories spanning from the ninth
to twenty-ﬁrst centuries, we had to crawl multiple sources and request access to onlineteaching material to put together pieces and make collections complete. Our corpus
was collected by crawling several Persian literary websites.
2The released version of
our corpus does not include poems from the twenty-ﬁrst century due to copyrightconcerns. However, we include modern poetry in our experimental analyses in Sect. 4.
We have obtained all required permissions to release the rest of the corpus publicly.
2.2 Linguistic challenges
Persian is an Indo-European language with a comparably rich morphology, conven-
tionally written in Arabic script. The language poses a number of special challenges.
Orthographic variability results from the frequent omission of vowel diacritics, alter-
native encoding of characters, and diverse shapes for afﬁxes. Additional challengesinclude morphological complexities in the inﬂectional paradigms for nouns, verbs
and adjectives, which involve multiple stems for verbs, and irregularities in nouns and
verbs borrowed from Arabic. The language allows free word order, with a default ofSOV .
2.3 Normalization and cleaning process
To ensure the quality of the data, we relied on both automated means and manual
corrections. An important aspect of this is orthographic normalization. For this task,ﬁrst we tokenized each line using space and punctuation characters as separators. We
developed a tool to normalize Persian text in accordance with the list of undesired
forms proposed by the Academy of Persian Language and Literature.
3According to
these, the use of certain letters and letter combinations, imported from general Arabic
and Western usage, is deemed incorrect. We have replaced such instances with the
standard form of Persian letters.
Arabic characters that are represented with alternative Unicode codepoints have
been replaced with their correct Persian form. Such cases typically are the result of

using an Arabic keyboard layout. For instance, Arabic Letter kaf (U+0643 ) is replaced
with Arabic letter keheh (U+06A9 ) and Arabic letter high Hamza Waw (U+0676 )i s
replaced with Arabic letter Waw with Hamze above (U+0624 ).
Left-to-right and Right-to-left control characters are removed, since the script is
always right to left. We did not remove Zero width non-joiner (U+200C ), since it is
commonly used in Persian for inﬂected adjectives and nouns, as well as for morpho-logical changes in verbs to show tense, aspect, and mood of the verb.
We are distributing the normalized version of the data (Raji et al., 2023 ). While
normalization tools for Farsi are readily accessible, our approach prioritizes ensuringa high level of quality of the data instead of relying on such tools. Considering the
limitations of most spell-checkers that are tailored to contemporary Farsi text, these
tools may not adequately handle older prose or poetry.
Moreover, while the large size of the corpus makes manual proofreading pro-
hibitively costly, we have corrected instances of misspellings as we came across them
while working with the data. After cleaning, the vocabulary size is reduced by around3000.
3 Corpus annotation
The corpus includes the poet and century as metadata. We annotated each poem based
on an inventory of styles and temporal periods. Additionally, we partially annotated
the corpus with six rhetorical ﬁgures commonly used in Persian poetry.
3.1 Style, author, and temporal annotations
3.1.1 Background on Persian poetry styles
Classical style Classical Persian poetry is classiﬁed into conventional styles in part
based on different metrical and structural features. The prosody of classical Persianverse is based on the line, called a bayt , which consists of half lines that are metrically
identical (Tousi, 1974 ; Tabatabai, 2001 ; Shamisa, 1999 ; Perry, 2011 ). Figures 2and 3
from Sect. 3show examples of two lines of a poem. The half-lines are usually written
side by side.
Different styles of classic poetry are usually distinguishable by examining the
rhymes of the words in the half-lines. Some of the styles have a similar pattern of
rhymes, in which case the content and topic of the poem may be used to classify them.
Figure 1illustrates the differences and similarities in the four most prevalent styles
in Persian poetry. Note that Persian has a right-to-left script. The letters at the end
of each half-line indicate the position of rhyming words or phrases, which signal
different styles. As shown, in Masnavi each pair of half-lines have their own rhyme,
while in Ghazal the rhymes occur at the end of each line. Hence, these two styles
can be distinguished just by the positions of their rhymes. In contrast, the position
of the rhyming words in the two styles of ghazal andqaside are the same. However,
aqaside could be used by religious poets as an educational poem, whereas ghazals
123S. Raji et al.
Fig. 1 Structure of rhyming words in different classical style. The letters indicate the position of the rhyming
words
(literally: love-songs) are much shorter poems, adopted by mystic poets and Suﬁs as
a medium for the expression of love for the divine. From the fourteenth century CE,
Persian poets became more interested in ghazals, and the qasida form declined.
Modern poetry Poetry remained a prominent form of literature in Iran through the
twenty-ﬁrst century. The modern style does not possess the features of the traditional
styles and has different topics, content, and goals. Poems are not conﬁned to the twohalf-lines format and the rhetorical ﬁgures, themes, metrics, and prosody are different,
making this style easily distinguishable from classical poetry.
3.1.2 Annotation process
We manually labeled the collections with their styles. For this annotation, each collec-
tion was labelled by two annotators. The annotators and adjudicators are all adult nativeFarsi speakers, expert linguists, and completed at least two undergraduate classes in
Persian literature and poetry.
Most of the collections have different chapters with different styles and the most
prominent collections were annotated with corresponding styles. While our paper does
not delve into the intricacies of Persian poetic meters that deﬁne ﬁne-grained styles
and genres, we have focused on "Masnavi", "Ghazal", "Qaside", and "Modern" styles
for our annotations. The inter-rater agreement for style is almost perfect ( κ=0.96).
We study this data in further detail in Sect. 4.
We also included the name of the poet and centuries following classiﬁcations pro-
posed in the humanities (Safa, 1993 ;B r o w n e , 1999 ; Rypka, 2013 ). This information
was taken from the metadata available in the original sources. Table 2shows the
distribution of poets across different centuries.
3.2 Rhetorical figure annotations
Persian poetry uses rich symbolism (Seyed-Gohrab, 2011 ), and from the very begin-
ning has extensively relied on a diverse inventory of rhetorical ﬁgures (Seyed-Gohrab,2011 ; Arberry, 2008 ;L e w i s , 2014 ;M e i s a m i , 2014 ). Traditional ﬁgures of Persian
rhetoric, when being analyzed in their stylistic function and expressive potential, are
useful tools for describing the poet’s style and imagery. While these devices and tech-niques are studied in several domains (Tom & Eves, 2012 ;B u s h , 2012 ; Fengjie et al.,
2016 ; García et al., 2018 ) in other languages, this is the ﬁrst large resource available
to study them in Persian.

aNote that twenty-ﬁrst century is not released with the corpus due to
copyright concerns
We chose the collection of ghazals byHafez , which consists of 4192 lines of poems.
We choose to work with this collection since the poems are among the most complex
ghazals yet also the most popular in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. This collection
was chosen because of its rich symbolism and the important role of Hafez in Persian
literature and culture. The analysis in Asgari et al. ( 2013 ) is on the same poetry style.
3.2.1 Background on rhetorical ﬁgures
There are many rhetorical ﬁgures in Persian. Here, we brieﬂy explain the six rhetorical
ﬁgures used in this study. The decision to use these ﬁgures is based on their frequency
in Persian poetry and their similarity to ﬁgures used in English. Note, however, thatthe English counterparts may have some differences with the forms as used in Persian.
Iham The term Iham literally means creating doubt. or making one suppose. It refers
to a deliberate use of lexical ambiguity, whereby the poet employs a word with two
different meanings and arranges the context surrounding it in a way that one meaning
is more immediate and the other remote, yet both can make sense.
As an example, the word
“/chare8/char58/char51/char4b/char12”(curtain) refers to two concepts; 1. the penetralia,
the most intimate part of the house, and 2. two semitones in traditional Persian music.This rhetorical ﬁgure is designed in a way that its direct meaning is the ﬁrst thing that
comes to the mind but really the remote meaning is intended.
Majaz (metonymy) Majaz refers to when only the related meaning of the word is
intended. For example, when a part of a whole is used instead of the whole, such as
when
“/char51/chare5/char85”(head) is used instead of person .
123S. Raji et al.
Esteara (metaphor) Esteara refers to a form of metaphor based on similarities of
with the intended subject, where the subject is removed, for example,/char51/char1e/char0a/char11/char83(lion) in
certain contexts means a brave warrior. Or/char11/char81/char1d/char40/char10/char0e
(ﬁre) can, metaphorically, describe the
sorrow of losing the lover. In example (1), musk deer is a metaphor for the poet’s lover.

return- IMP Khotan to musk deer-CONJ that God O
O God, guide the musk deer back to Khotan.
Kenaya This refers to a particular kind of esteara , which we annotate separately
due to its particular prominence, including in everyday language. A kenaya is a form
of allusion employed when being indirect is deemed more polite, appropriate, or
preferable for other reasons. In example (1) earlier, Khotan , the name of an ancient city
near Kashgar, China, is used as a kenaya for the hometown of the poet. In many cases,
kenayas are phrases. Example (2) below means “having intentions to do something”.
Literal meanings of Examples (3) and (4) are to “draw on the water” and “to give to thewind”. As a kenaya , they mean “to do something in vain” and “to waste”, respectively.

Tashbih (simile) In most of the cases, such similes in Persian poetry come with
an explicit marker, such as “x like y” or “x as y”. As in English, when the markeris removed, tashbih is very similar to esteara (metaphor). The top most frequent
unigrams that are used with this rhetorical ﬁgure in Hafez poetry are:/char09/charad/charcb/char09/char50(hair),/chard1/char6b/char2e/chard0/char41/char67/char2e
(love), and /charc8/char58(heart).
Jenas This device involves the use of words that are (or appear to be) derived from a
common root, as in example (6), /char09/char50/char41/char09/char4b(pronounced n¯az) and/char09/char50/char41/char4a/char0a/char09/char4b(pronounced ny¯az). There
are two kinds of jenas : (a) when the two words are homonyms, and (b) when they are
very similar in writing or pronunciation.
The examples below include pairs of words in a line that are similar in spelling
or pronunciations. These words can appear in any order or anywhere within a line.
Incidentally, in example (6), when the two words are used together/char10/char87/charca/charaa/char10/char4b:/charc1/char09/char4b/char50(goblet of
the king ) is a metaphor for the universe.

A complete list of identiﬁed jenas is released along with the corpus. Figure 2shows
an example of jenas where two homonyms are used with different meanings.
3.2.2 Annotation process
For these annotations, the words or phrases corresponding to the rhetorical ﬁgures in
each line of poem are labelled by two annotators.4The annotators and adjudicators
underwent a substantial period of training on the relevant linguistic devices beforeconducting the annotation. In our annotation protocol, we ask the annotators to label
the six rhetorical ﬁgures described above. We prepared an annotation platform for the
annotators where they could choose among the deﬁned rhetorical devices and explaintheir observations. Each line of a poem was annotated with up to six rhetorical ﬁgures.
Figure 3shows three rhetorical ﬁgures used in one line of poetry. In general, spans of
text are annotated, and some ﬁgures require marking multiple spans.
Some of these ﬁgures are purely morphological (e.g., jenas ), or the words and
phrase do not have a second meaning (e.g., tashbih ). For others, the annotation also
provides the literal meaning of each word or phrase when needed.
Fortashbih , the annotators marked the word that is described by another word
in the poem. For example, in Fig. 3, “belonging” is described as being similar to “a
paint” that covers whatever is underneath it. This relationship is labelled as
/char10/char87/charca/charaa/char10/char4b:/charc1/char09/char4b/char50
(belonging:color) in the annotations. For jenas , the annotators provide the pair of
words in the poem that create the rhetorical ﬁgure. The poem in Fig. 2is annotated as
/char59/char09/char4a/char09/char4b/char41/chard3/char50/char58–/char59/char09/char4a/char09/char4b/char41/chard3/char50/char58 (remedy–distress) for jenas . The words creating the rhetorical ﬁgure are
highlighted in both poems.
Iham ,kenaya ,esteara , and majaz are more involved. For each word or phrase, the
annotators provide the concept or concepts that is described by that word or phrase.
Since the concept is not in the poem, it can be described in different ways. Hence,
an adjudication process was used to select a consistent description after the initialannotation process. For iham , which are inherently ambiguous, the annotation does
not indicate which meaning may be the intended one.
4The research has been approved by our institutional review board for human subject studies. The annotators
were paid a rate of $20/h.

3.2.3 Annotation results
We chose the collection of ghazals byHafez and present annotations for 4192 lines of
poetry. The inter-annotator agreement was measured at the line level across a test setof 500 lines and resulted in a Cohen’s κscore of 0.78 (average across the rhetorical
ﬁgures), which indicates strong agreement between annotators. Table 3shows what
fraction of lines contain each of the rhetorical ﬁgures. We observe that kenaya is
particularly common in the annotated data.
4 Experiments and analysis
In this section, we study how NLP techniques can be used automatically for informed
explorations of Persian text at a variety of different analytical levels. We also provide
detailed information about the distribution of texts over time, word counts, the averagelength of lines in poems in classic and modern texts, and more. However, we will focus
our analysis on Persian poetry in this paper.
4.1 Style classification
In this section, we present several baselines for style prediction in Persian poetry.
123A corpus of Persian literary text
4.1.1 Rule-based approach
We have implemented an open source tool that recognizes classical styles of Persian
poetry, except for ghazal andqaside , using a rule-based algorithm based on formal
features. As shown in Fig. 1, only these two styles of classical Persian poetry remain
that cannot be distinguished using rules. Hence, the algorithm ﬁrst looks at the positions
of rhyming words and attempts to predict the style of the poem using simple rules.
4.1.2 Supervised learning
To distinguish between ghazal andqaside , we train a supervised model. We compiled
a dataset of 1100 poems, 595 of which are ghazals , based on the most notable poets
in each style,5We established a train–test split at a 80–20% ratio. As models, we
consider a convolutional neural network (CNN) (Kim, 2014 ) as well as a linear SVM
model. The CNN model consists of a convolutional layer and a fully-connected layerto predict the label. A dropout rate of 0.5 is applied to the convolutional layer. The
CNN model obtains an accuracy of 74%, while the SVM sentence classiﬁer obtains
an accuracy of 95%. The lower accuracy of the former stems from the small size ofthe training data.
4.1.3 Modern style classiﬁcation
Themodern style merits special consideration. The rhetorical ﬁgures, themes, met-
rics and prosody are different, making this style easily distinguishable from classical
poetry. We also observed a considerable difference in the length of poems compared to
classical styles. However, the difference between half-lines and lines is not as obviousas in classical Persian poems.
We found that poems of the twenty-ﬁrst century can easily be distinguished from
others by the two models. The same SVM model using Bag-of-words and CNN modelusing a word2vec model as input both attain an accuracy of 89% at distinguishing
modern poetry from classic poetry. The word2vec embedding model was trained on
our corpus.
4.2 Poet and century classification
In what follows, we describe baseline experiments for predicting the century and the
poet of poems from different historic periods.
4.2.1 Models
To further study the differences and commonalities between poems in different cen-
turies and the style of authors, we ran a linear SVM model with Bag-of-Word features
using a train–test split of 85–15%. Another CNN model uses word2vec (trained on

kernel sizes of 4 and 10, a max-pooling layer, and two dense layers for predicting the
labels. As in our previous model, a dropout rate of 0.5 is applied to the hidden layer.
4.2.2 Results
The results in Table 4show that using different inputs and the unbalanced size of the test
sets for each class signiﬁcantly affect the CNN model. A t-test indicates statistically

Fig. 4 The confusion matrix for century classiﬁcation. The results are largely better for the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and twenty-ﬁrst century because cleaner data is available. Whereas, the results for some time
periods are not good due to the small size of the dataset or similarity between the author styles
4.3 Tracking changes in context
In addition to the usage of the words as rhetorical ﬁgures, another meaningful study
is to assess context shifts of words.
4.3.1 Algorithm
To observe how the contexts of words have changed over time, we applied dynamic
Bernoulli embedding for language evolution (Rudolph & Blei, 2018 ) on our data. The
method was originally devised to study language evolution and meaning shifts. We
adapt the method to instead study changes in the contexts of words over time. Othermethods that study context changes (Mihalcea & Nastase, 2012 ; Hamilton et al., 2016 )
propose algorithms for aligning embeddings that are trained separately on data in each
time slice. However, such algorithms are highly sensitive to the size of the data that is
123S. Raji et al.
Fig. 5 Example of a line (two half lines) of a poem by Hafez with wine referring to the alcohol prohibition
in the Islamic era. Wine here is used an a symbol of all of the prohibited activities
used in each slice. Since the time slices in our corpus are very heterogeneous in size,
such algorithms are not good candidates for our analysis.
4.3.2 Results
As we can observe in Table 5,wine ,beware ,message ,king , and mirror exhibit the
highest drifts. The given numbers represent the absolute total drift of the word vector,
assessed in terms of the Euclidean distance between the words’ embeddings between
the ﬁrst and the ﬁnal time slices (Rudolph & Blei, 2018 ).
The change of context for some of these words such as wine andking in the history of
Persian poetry have been the subject of previous studies (Kadkani, 1943 ; Sharifnasab,
2004 ; Shabestary, 2008 ). The results of our analysis accord well with the explanations
and observations made in these works. For instance, neighboring words of wine have
changed from lover ,beloved ,dance , and happy in Suﬁ poetry to martyr ,blood ,country ,
andwar. One sub-cluster of this includes words such as forbidden andaffectation that
refer to alcohol prohibition in the Islamic era. Figure 5presents an example of this
case.
This has also been the subject of poetry critics (Pourjavadi, 2008 ). The context of
king changed from the tenth and eleventh centuries (mostly inﬂuenced by Ferdowsi,
Hafez, and Rumi), from land ,war,horse togift,heart ,love ,poverty . The complete
list of words together with the result of the analysis and code is attached with this
submission.6
5 Conclusion
Preservation, revitalization, and documentation purposes call for the availability ofcomputational resources and methodologies for low-resource languages. We take a
step forward with this by furthering research not just for modern Farsi, but also mid-dle and old Persian, by introducing a large standardized and machine-readable corpus
of Persian literary text that is annotated for century and style. We have additionally
annotated Hafez’s ghazals with critical rhetorical ﬁgures such as metaphor . Our com-
putational experiments provide insights into how Persian poetic language has evolved.

123A corpus of Persian literary text
Additionally, our investigations suggest the effectiveness of supervised and unsuper-
vised techniques in studying poems and poetic styles.
By expanding the range of languages traditionally studied by computational linguis-
tics, low-resource languages often represent a test-bed for validating current methods
and techniques. Our resource can contribute to research on metaphor, lexical seman-
tics, text generation, and entailment in addition to cross-linguistic studies. Althoughthese have been studied in a number of poems over the years in the linguistics and
Persian literature departments, such studies have never had the tools and resources to
consider such a wide coverage corpus while taking advantage of NLP techniques.
