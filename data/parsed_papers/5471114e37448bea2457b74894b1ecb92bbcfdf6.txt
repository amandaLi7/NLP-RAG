Abstract
Language models (LMs) are pretrained on di-
verse data sources, including news, discussion
forums, books, and online encyclopedias. A sig-
nificant portion of this data includes opinions
and perspectives which, on one hand, celebrate
democracy and diversity of ideas, and on the
other hand are inherently socially biased. Our
work develops new methods to (1) measure po-
litical biases in LMs trained on such corpora,
along social and economic axes, and (2) mea-
sure the fairness of downstream NLP models
trained on top of politically biased LMs. We
focus on hate speech and misinformation de-
tection, aiming to empirically quantify the ef-
fects of political (social, economic) biases in
pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes
social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that
pretrained LMs do have political leanings that
reinforce the polarization present in pretrain-
ing corpora, propagating social biases into hate
speech predictions and misinformation detec-
tors. We discuss the implications of our findings
for NLP research and propose future directions
to mitigate unfairness.1

speech.
1 Introduction
Digital and social media have become a major
source of political news dissemination (Hermida
et al., 2012; Kümpel et al., 2015; Hermida, 2016)
with unprecedentedly high user engagement rates
(Mustafaraj and Metaxas, 2011; Velasquez, 2012;
Garimella et al., 2018). The volume of online
discourse surrounding polarizing issues—climate
change, gun control, abortion, wage gaps, death
penalty, taxes, same-sex marriage, and more—has
been drastically growing in the past decade (Valen-
zuela et al., 2012; Rainie et al., 2012; Enikolopov
et al., 2019). While online political engagement
1Code and data are publicly available at https://github.
com/BunsenFeng/PoliLean .promotes democratic values and diversity of per-
spectives, these discussions also reflect and rein-
force societal biases—stereotypical generalizations
about people or social groups (Devine, 1989; Bargh,
1999; Blair, 2002). Such language constitutes a ma-
jor portion of large language models’ (LMs) pre-
training data, propagating biases into downstream
models.
Hundreds of studies have highlighted ethical is-
sues in NLP models (Blodgett et al., 2020a; Field
et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022) and designed syn-
thetic datasets (Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al.,
2021) or controlled experiments to measure how
biases in language are encoded in learned represen-
tations (Sun et al., 2019), and how annotator errors
in training data are liable to increase unfairness
of NLP models (Sap et al., 2019). However, the
language of polarizing political issues is particu-
larly complex (Demszky et al., 2019), and social
biases hidden in language can rarely be reduced to
pre-specified stereotypical associations (Joseph and
Morgan, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has shown how to analyze the effects of
naturally occurring media biases in pretraining data
on language models, and subsequently on down-
stream tasks, and how it affects the fairness towards
diverse social groups. Our study aims to fill this
gap.
As a case study, we focus on the effects of media
biases in pretraining data on the fairness of hate
speech detection with respect to diverse social at-
tributes, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion,
and sexual orientation, and of misinformation de-
tection with respect to partisan leanings. We investi-
gate how media biases in the pretraining data prop-
agate into LMs and ultimately affect downstream
tasks, because discussions about polarizing social
and economic issues are abundant in pretraining
data sourced from news, forums, books, and online
encyclopedias, and this language inevitably perpet-
uates social stereotypes. We choose hate speecharXiv:2305.08283v3  [cs.CL]  6 Jul 2023and misinformation classification because these are
social-oriented tasks in which unfair predictions
can be especially harmful (Duggan, 2017; League,
2019, 2021).
To this end, grounded in political spectrum the-
ories (Eysenck, 1957; Rokeach, 1973; Gindler,
2021) and the political compass test,2we propose
to empirically quantify the political leaning of pre-
trained LMs (§2). We then further pretrain language
models on different partisan corpora to investigate
whether LMs pick up political biases from training
data. Finally, we train classifiers on top of LMs
with varying political leanings and evaluate their
performance on hate speech instances targeting dif-
ferent identity groups (Yoder et al., 2022), and on
misinformation detection with different agendas
(Wang, 2017). In this way, we investigate the prop-
agation of political bias through the entire pipeline
from pretraining data to language models to down-
stream tasks.
Our experiments across several data domains,
partisan news datasets, and LM architectures (§3)
demonstrate that different pretrained LMs dohave
different underlying political leanings, reinforc-
ing the political polarization present in pretraining
corpora (§4.1). Further, while the overall perfor-
mance of hate speech and misinformation detectors
remains consistent across such politically-biased
LMs, these models exhibit significantly different
behaviors against different identity groups and par-
tisan media sources. (§4.2).
The main contributions of this paper are novel
methods to quantify political biases in LMs, and
findings that shed new light on how ideological
polarization in pretraining corpora propagates bi-
ases into language models, and subsequently into
social-oriented downstream tasks. In §5, we discuss
implications of our findings for NLP research, that
no language model can be entirely free from social
biases , and propose future directions to mitigate
unfairness.
2 Methodology
We propose a two-step methodology to establish
the effect of political biases in pretraining corpora
on the fairness of downstream tasks: (1) we develop
a framework, grounded in political science litera-
ture, to measure the inherent political leanings of
pretrained language models, and (2) then investi-
2https://www.politicalcompass.org/testgate how the political leanings of LMs affect their
performance in downstream social-oriented tasks.
2.1 Measuring the Political Leanings of LMs
While prior works provided analyses of political
leanings in LMs (Jiang et al., 2022a; Argyle et al.,
2022), they primarily focused on political individ-
uals, rather than the timeless ideological issues
grounded in political science literature. In con-
trast, our method is grounded in political spectrum
theories (Eysenck, 1957; Rokeach, 1973; Gindler,
2021) that provide more nuanced perspective than
the commonly used left vs. right distinction (Bob-
bio, 1996; Mair, 2007; Corballis and Beale, 2020)
by assessing political positions on two axes: social
values (ranging from liberal to conservative) and
economic values (ranging from left to right).
The widely adopted political compass test ,2
which is based on these theories, measures indi-
viduals’ leaning on a two-dimensional space by an-
alyzing their responses to 62 political statements.3
Participants indicate their level of agreement or dis-
agreement with each statement, and their responses
are used to calculate their social and economic
scores through weighted summation. Formally,
the political compass test maps a set of answers
indicating agreement level {STRONG DISAGREE ,
DISAGREE ,AGREE ,STRONG AGREE }62to two-
dimensional point (ssoc, seco), where the social
score ssocand economic score secorange from
[−10,10]. We employ this test as a tool to mea-
sure the political leanings of pretrained language
models.
We probe a diverse set of LMs to measure their
alignment with specific political statements, in-
cluding encoder and language generation mod-
els (decoder and autoregressive). For encoder-
only LMs, we use mask filling with prompts de-
rived from the political statements. We construct
the following prompt: “Please respond to the
following statement: [STATEMENT ]I <MASK>
with this statement. ” Then, pretrained LMs fill
the mask and return 10 highest probability to-
kens. By comparing the aggregated probabil-
ity of pre-defined positive ( agree, support, en-
dorse , etc.) and negative lexicons ( disagree, re-
fute, oppose , etc.) assigned by LMs, we map
their answers to {STRONG DISAGREE ,DISAGREE ,
AGREE ,STRONG AGREE }. Specifically, if the ag-

gregated probability of positive lexicon scores is
larger than the negative aggregate by 0.3,4we
deem the response as STRONG AGREE , and define
STRONG DISAGREE analogously.
We probe language generation models by con-
ducting text generation based on the following
prompt: “Please respond to the following state-
ment: [STATEMENT ]\n Your response:” . We then
use an off-the-shelf stance detector (Lewis et al.,
2019) to determine whether the generated response
agrees or disagrees with the given statement. We
use 10 random seeds for prompted generation, filter
low-confidence responses using the stance detector,
and average the stance detection scores for a more
reliable evaluation.5
Using this framework, we aim to systematically
evaluate the effect of polarization in pretraining
data on the political bias of LMs. We thus train
multiple partisan LMs through continued pretrain-
ing of existing LMs on data from various political
viewpoints, and then evaluate how model’s ideo-
logical coordinates shift. In these experiments, we
only use established media sources, because our
ultimate goal is to understand whether “clean” pre-
training data (not overtly hateful or toxic) leads to
undesirable biases in downstream tasks.
2.2 Measuring the Effect of LM’s Political
Bias on Downstream Task Performance
Armed with the LM political leaning evaluation
framework, we investigate the impact of these bi-
ases on downstream tasks with social implications
such as hate speech detection and misinformation
identification. We fine-tune different partisan ver-
sions of the same LM architecture on these tasks
and datasets and analyze the results from two per-
spectives. This is a controlled experiment setting,
i.e.only the partisan pretraining corpora is differ-
ent, while the starting LM checkpoint, task-specific
fine-tuning data, and all hyperparameters are the

tive and negative lexicons as well as the specific hyperparame-
ters used for response mapping are listed in Appendix A.1.
5We established empirically that using multiple prompts
results in more stable and consistent responses.same. First, we look at overall performance differ-
ences across LMs with different leanings. Second,
we examine per-category performance, breaking
down the datasets into different socially informed
groups (identity groups for hate speech and me-
dia sources for misinformation), to determine if
the inherent political bias in LMs could lead to
unfairness in downstream applications.
3 Experiment Settings
LM and Stance Detection Model We evaluate
political biases of 14 language models: BERT (De-
vlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), dis-
tilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019), distilRoBERTa, AL-
BERT (Lan et al., 2019), BART (Lewis et al., 2020),
GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-3 (Brown et al.,
2020), GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021),
LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Alpaca (Taori et al.,
2023), Codex (Chen et al., 2021), ChatGPT, GPT-4
(OpenAI, 2023) and their variants, representing a
diverse range of model sizes and architectures. The
specific versions and checkpoint names of each
model are provided in Appendix C. For the stance
detection model used for evaluating decoder-based
language model responses, we use a BART-based
model (Lewis et al., 2019) trained on MultiNLI
(Williams et al., 2018).
To ensure the reliability of the off-the-shelf
stance detector, we conduct a human evaluation
on 110 randomly sampled responses and com-
pare the results to those generated by the detector.
The stance detector has an accuracy of 0.97 for
LM responses with clear stances and high inter-
annotator agreement among 3 annotators (0.85
Fleiss’ Kappa). Details on the stance detector, the
response-to-agreement mapping process, and the
human evaluation are in Appendix A.2.
Partisan Corpora for Pretraining We collected
partisan corpora for LM pretraining that focus on
two dimensions: domain (news and social media)
and political leaning (left, center, right). We used
the POLITICS dataset (Liu et al., 2022a) for news
articles, divided into left-leaning, right-leaning, andStatement GPT-2 GPT-3 Ada GPT-3 Davinci
A significant advantage of
a one-party state is that it
avoids all the arguments that

the right to an elected leader. And
for that to happen, the need to es-

crucial .One major advantage of a one-party
state is that it prevents independent
political arguments from delaying

because it allows the state to be the

the rise of political movements that

center categories based on Allsides.6For social
media, we use the left-leaning and right-leaning
subreddit lists by Shen and Rose (2021) and the
PushShift API (Baumgartner et al., 2020). We also
include subreddits that are not about politics as the
center corpus for social media. Additionally, to ad-
dress ethical concerns of creating hateful LMs, we
used a hate speech classifier based on RoBERTa
(Liu et al., 2019) and fine-tuned on the TweetEval
benchmark (Barbieri et al., 2020) to remove po-
tentially hateful content from the pretraining data.
As a result, we obtained six pretraining corpora
of comparable sizes: {LEFT,CENTER ,RIGHT } ×
{REDDIT ,NEWS}.7These partisan pretraining cor-
pora are approximately the same size. We further
pretrain RoBERTa and GPT-2 on these corpora to
evaluate their changes in ideological coordinates
and to examine the relationship between the polit-
ical bias in the pretraining data and the model’s
political leaning.
Downstream Task Datasets We investigate the
connection between models’ political biases and
their downstream task behavior on two tasks:
hate speech and misinformation detection. For
hate speech detection, we adopt the dataset pre-
sented in Yoder et al. (2022) which includes ex-
amples divided into the identity groups that were
targeted. We leverage the two official dataset
splits in this work: HATE-IDENTITY andHATE-
DEMOGRAPHIC . For misinformation detection, the
standard PolitiFact dataset (Wang, 2017) is adopted,

4 Results and Analysis
In this section, we first evaluate the inherent politi-
cal leanings of language models and their connec-
tion to political polarization in pretraining corpora.
We then evaluate pretrained language models with
different political leanings on hate speech and mis-
information detection, aiming to understand the∆= (-2.75,-1.24) ∆=(-0.13,-1.03) ∆=(1.63,1.03) ∆=(0.75, -3.64) ∆=(-0.50,-3.64) ∆=(-1.75,0.92) ∆= (-2.75,-1.24) ∆=(-0.13,-1.03) ∆=(1.63,1.03) ∆=(0.75, -3.64) ∆=(-0.50,-3.64) ∆=(-1.75,0.92)

could pick up the heightened polarization in news and social media due to socio-political events.

and fairness issues in LM-based task solutions.
4.1 Political Bias of Language Models
Political Leanings of Pretrained LMs Figure 1
illustrates the political leaning results for a variety
of vanilla pretrained LM checkpoints. Specifically,
each original LM is mapped to a social score and
an economic score with our proposed framework
in Section 2.1. From the results, we find that:
•Language models doexhibit different ideological
leanings, occupying all four quadrants on the
political compass.
•Generally, BERT variants of LMs are more so-
cially conservative (authoritarian) compared to
GPT model variants. This collective difference
may be attributed to the composition of pre-
training corpora: while the BookCorpus (Zhu
et al., 2015) played a significant role in early
LM pretraining, Web texts such as Common-Crawl8and WebText (Radford et al., 2019) have
become dominant pretraining corpora in more
recent models. Since modern Web texts tend to
be more liberal (libertarian) than older book texts
(Bell, 2014), it is possible that LMs absorbed this
liberal shift in pretraining data. Such differences
could also be in part attributed to the reinforce-
ment learning with human feedback data adopted
in GPT-3 models and beyond. We additionally
observe that different sizes of the same model
family (e.g. ALBERT and BART) could have
non-negligible differences in political leanings.
We hypothesize that the change is due to a better
generalization in large LMs, including overfitting
biases in more subtle contexts, resulting in a shift
of political leaning. We leave further investiga-
tion to future work.
•Pretrained LMs exhibit stronger bias towards so-
cial issues ( yaxis) compared to economic ones ( x
axis). The average magnitude for social and eco-
nomic issues is 2.97and0.87, respectively, with
standard deviations of 1.29and0.84. This sug-
gests that pretrained LMs show greater disagree-
ment in their values concerning social issues. A
possible reason is that the volume of social issue
discussions on social media is higher than eco-
nomic issues (Flores-Saviaga et al., 2022; Ray-
mond et al., 2022), since the bar for discussing
economic issues is higher (Crawford et al., 2017;
Johnston and Wronski, 2015), requiring back-
ground knowledge and a deeper understanding
of economics.
8https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/We conducted a qualitative analysis to compare
the responses of different LMs. Table 2 presents the
responses of three pretrained LMs to political state-
ments. While GPT-2 expresses support for “tax the
rich”, GPT-3 Ada and Davinci are clearly against
it. Similar disagreements are observed regarding
the role of women in the workforce, democratic
governments, and the social responsibility of cor-
porations.
The Effect of Pretraining with Partisan Corpora
Figure 3 shows the re-evaluated political leaning of
RoBERTa and GPT-2 after being further pretrained
with 6 partisan pretraining corpora (§3):
•LMs doacquire political bias from pretrain-
ing corpora. Left-leaning corpora generally re-
sulted in a left/liberal shift on the political
compass, while right-leaning corpora led to a
right/conservative shift from the checkpoint. This
is particularly noticeable for RoBERTa further
pretrained on REDDIT -LEFT , which resulted in a
substantial liberal shift in terms of social values
(2.97to−3.03). However, most of the ideologi-
cal shifts are relatively small, suggesting that it
is hard to alter the inherent bias present in initial
pretrained LMs. We hypothesize that this may be
due to differences in the size and training time of
the pretraining corpus, which we further explore
when we examine hyperpartisan LMs.
•For RoBERTa, the social media corpus led to an
average change of 1.60 in social values, while
the news media corpus resulted in a change of
0.64. For economic values, the changes were
0.90 and 0.61 for news and social media, re-
spectively. User-generated texts on social media
have a greater influence on the social values of
LMs, while news media has a greater influence
on economic values. We speculate that this can
be attributed to the difference in coverage (Cac-
ciatore et al., 2012; Guggenheim et al., 2015):
while news media often reports on economic is-
sues (Ballon, 2014), political discussions on so-
cial media tend to focus more on controversial
“culture wars” and social issues (Amedie, 2015).
Pre-Trump vs. Post-Trump News and social
media are timely reflections of the current senti-
ment of society, and there is evidence (Abramowitz
and McCoy, 2019; Galvin, 2020; Hout and Mag-
gio, 2021) suggesting that polarization is at an all-
time high since the election of Donald Trump, the
45th president of the United States. To examine

whether our framework detects the increased polar-
ization in the general public, we add a pre- and post-
Trump dimension to our partisan corpora by fur-
ther partitioning the 6 pretraining corpora into pre-
and post-January 20, 2017. We then pretrain the
RoBERTa and GPT-2 checkpoints with the pre- and
post-Trump corpora respectively. Figure 2 demon-
strates that LMs indeed pick up the heightened
polarization present in pretraining corpora, result-
ing in LMs positioned further away from the center.
In addition to this general trend, for RoBERTa and
theREDDIT -RIGHT corpus, the post-Trump LM is
more economically left than the pre-Trump coun-
terpart. Similar results are observed for GPT-2 and
theNEWS-RIGHT corpus. This may seem counter-
intuitive at first glance, but we speculate that it
provides preliminary evidence that LMs could also
detect the anti-establishment sentiment regarding
economic issues among right-leaning communities,
similarly observed as the Sanders-Trump voter phe-
nomenon (Bump, 2016; Trudell, 2016).
Examining the Potential of Hyperpartisan LMs
Since pretrained LMs could move further away
from the center due to further pretraining on par-
tisan corpora, it raises a concern about dual use:
training a hyperpartisan LM and employing it to
further deepen societal divisions. We hypothesize
that this might be achieved by pretraining for more
epochs and with more partisan data. To test this,
we further pretrain the RoBERTa checkpoint with
more epochs and larger corpus size and examine
the trajectory on the political compass. Figure 4
demonstrates that, fortunately, this simple strategy
isnotresulting in increasingly partisan LMs: on
economic issues, LMs remain close to the center;
on social issues, we observe that while pretraining
does lead to some changes, training with more dataModelHate-Identity Hate-Demographic Misinformation

4.2 Political Leaning and Downstream Tasks
Overall Performance We compare the perfor-
mance of five models: base RoBERTa and four
RoBERTa models further pretrained with REDDIT -
LEFT ,NEWS-LEFT ,REDDIT -RIGHT , and NEWS-
RIGHT corpora, respectively. Table 3 presents the
overall performance on hate speech and misin-
formation detection, which demonstrates that left-
leaning LMs generally slightly outperform right-
leaning LMs. The REDDIT -RIGHT corpus is espe-
cially detrimental to downstream task performance,
greatly trailing the vanilla RoBERTa without par-
tisan pretraining. The results demonstrate that the
political leaning of the pretraining corpus could
have a tangible impact on overall task performance.
Performance Breakdown by Categories In ad-
dition to aggregated performance, we investigate
how the performance of partisan models vary for
different targeted identity groups (e.g., Women,
LGBTQ+) and different sources of misinforma-
tion (e.g., CNN, Fox). Table 4 illustrates a notable
variation in the behavior of models based on their
political bias. In particular, for hate speech detec-
tion, models with left-leaning biases exhibit bet-
ter performance towards hate speech directed atwidely-regarded minority groups such as LGBTQ +
and BLACK , while models with right-leaning biases
tend to perform better at identifying hate speech tar-
geting dominant identity groups such as MEN and
WHITE . For misinformation detection, left-leaning
LMs are more stringent with misinformation from
right-leaning media but are less sensitive to misin-
formation from left-leaning sources such as CNN
andNYT . Right-leaning LMs show the opposite
pattern. These results highlight the concerns regard-
ing the amplification of political biases in pretrain-
ing data within LMs, which subsequently propagate
into downstream tasks and directly impact model
(un)fairness.
Table 5 provides further qualitative analysis and
examples that illustrate distinctive behaviors ex-
hibited by pretrained LMs with different political
leanings. Right-leaning LMs overlook racist accu-
sations of “race mixing with asians,” whereas left-
leaning LMs correctly identify such instances as
hate speech. In addition, both left- and right-leaning
LMs demonstrate double standards for misinforma-
tion regarding the inaccuracies in comments made
by Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.

regarding what constitutes as offensive or not, and
what is considered misinformation or not. For ex-
ample, if a content moderation model for detecting
hate speech is more sensitive to offensive content
directed at men than women, it can result in women
being exposed to more toxic content. Similarly, if
a misinformation detection model is excessively
sensitive to one side of a story and detects misin-
formation from that side more frequently, it can
create a skewed representation of the overall sit-
uation. We discuss two strategies to mitigate the
impact of political bias in LMs.
Partisan Ensemble The experiments in Section
4.2 show that LMs with different political biases
behave differently and have different strengths and
weaknesses when applied to downstream tasks. Mo-
tivated by existing literature on analyzing different
political perspectives in downstream tasks (Akhtar
et al., 2020; Flores-Saviaga et al., 2022), we pro-
pose using a combination, or ensemble, of pre-
trained LMs with different political leanings to take
advantage of their collective knowledge for down-
stream tasks. By incorporating multiple LMs repre-
senting different perspectives, we can introduce a
range of viewpoints into the decision-making pro-
cess, instead of relying solely on a single perspec-tive represented by a single language model. We
evaluate a partisan ensemble approach and report
the results in Table 6, which demonstrate that parti-
san ensemble actively engages diverse political per-
spectives, leading to improved model performance.
However, it is important to note that this approach
may incur additional computational cost and may
require human evaluation to resolve differences.
Strategic Pretraining Another finding is that
LMs are more sensitive towards hate speech and
misinformation from political perspectives that dif-
fer from their own. For example, a model becomes
better at identifying factual inconsistencies from
New York Times news when it is pretrained with
corpora from right-leaning sources.
This presents an opportunity to create models tai-
lored to specific scenarios. For example, in a down-
stream task focused on detecting hate speech from
white supremacy groups, it might be beneficial to
further pretrain LMs on corpora from communities
that are more critical of white supremacy. Strategic
pretraining might have great improvements in spe-
cific scenarios, but curating ideal scenario-specific
pretraining corpora may pose challenges.
Our work opens up a new avenue for identifying
the inherent political bias of LMs and further studyis suggested to better understand how to reduce and
leverage such bias for downstream tasks.
6 Related Work
Understanding Social Bias of LMs Studies have
been conducted to measure political biases and pre-
dict the ideology of individual users (Colleoni et al.,
2014; Makazhanov and Rafiei, 2013; Preo¸ tiuc-
Pietro et al., 2017), news articles (Li and Gold-
wasser, 2019; Feng et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b;
Zhang et al., 2022), and political entities (Anegundi
et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022). As extensive re-
search has shown that machine learning models ex-
hibit societal and political biases (Zhao et al., 2018;
Blodgett et al., 2020b; Bender et al., 2021; Ghosh
et al., 2021; Shaikh et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022;
Cao et al., 2022; Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2021; Jin
et al., 2021), there has been an increasing amount
of research dedicated to measuring the inherent
societal bias of these models using various compo-
nents, such as word embeddings (Bolukbasi et al.,
2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Kurita et al., 2019),
output probability (Borkan et al., 2019), and model
performance discrepancy (Hardt et al., 2016).
Recently, as generative models have become in-
creasingly popular, several studies have proposed to
probe political biases (Liu et al., 2021; Jiang et al.,
2022b) and prudence (Bang et al., 2021) of these
models. Liu et al. (2021) presented two metrics to
quantify political bias in GPT2 using a political
ideology classifier, which evaluate the probability
difference of generated text with and without at-
tributes (gender, location, and topic). Jiang et al.
(2022b) showed that LMs trained on corpora writ-
ten by active partisan members of a community
can be used to examine the perspective of the com-
munity and generate community-specific responses
to elicit opinions about political entities. Our pro-
posed method is distinct from existing methods as
it can be applied to a wide range of LMs includ-
ing encoder-based models, not just autoregressive
models. Additionally, our approach for measuring
political bias is informed by existing political sci-
ence literature and widely-used standard tests.
Impact of Model and Data Bias on Downstream
Task Fairness Previous research has shown that
the performance of models for downstream tasks
can vary greatly among different identity groups
(Hovy and Søgaard, 2015; Buolamwini and Gebru,
2018; Dixon et al., 2018), highlighting the issue
of fairness (Hutchinson and Mitchell, 2019; Liuet al., 2020). It is commonly believed that annota-
tor (Geva et al., 2019; Sap et al., 2019; Davani et al.,
2022; Sap et al., 2022) and data bias (Park et al.,
2018; Dixon et al., 2018; Dodge et al., 2021; Harris
et al., 2022) are the cause of this impact, and some
studies have investigated the connection between
training data and downstream task model behavior
(Gonen and Webster, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Dodge
et al., 2021). Our study adds to this by demonstrat-
ing the effects of political bias in training data on
downstream tasks, specifically in terms of fairness.
Previous studies have primarily examined the con-
nection between data bias and either model bias or
downstream task performance, with the exception
of Steed et al. (2022). Our study, however, takes
a more thorough approach by linking data bias
to model bias, and then to downstream task per-
formance, in order to gain a more complete under-
standing of the effect of social biases on the fairness
of models for downstream tasks. Also, most prior
work has primarily focused on investigating fair-
ness in hate speech detection models, but our study
highlights important fairness concerns in misinfor-
mation detection that require further examination.
7 Conclusion
We conduct a systematic analysis of the political
biases of language models. We probe LMs using
prompts grounded in political science and mea-
sure models’ ideological positions on social and
economic values. We also examine the influence
of political biases in pretraining data on the po-
litical leanings of LMs and investigate the model
performance with varying political biases on down-
stream tasks, finding that LMs may have different
standards for different hate speech targets and mis-
information sources based on their political biases.
Our work highlights that pernicious biases and
unfairness in downstream tasks can be caused by
non-toxic data, which includes diverse opinions,
but there are subtle imbalances in data distributions.
Prior work discussed data filtering or augmenta-
tion techniques as a remedy (Kaushik et al., 2019);
while useful in theory, these approaches might not
be applicable in real-world settings, running the
risk of censorship and exclusion from political par-
ticipation. In addition to identifying these risks, we
discuss strategies to mitigate the negative impacts
while preserving the diversity of opinions in pre-
training data.Limitations
The Political Compass Test In this work, we
leveraged the political compass test as a test bed to
probe the underlying political leaning of pretrained
language models. While the political compass test
is a widely adopted and straightforward toolkit, it
is far from perfect and has several limitations: 1)
In addition to a two-axis political spectrum on so-
cial and economic values (Eysenck, 1957), there
are numerous political science theories (Blattberg,
2001; Horrell, 2005; Diamond and Wolf, 2017)
that support other ways of categorizing political
ideologies. 2) The political compass test focuses
heavily on the ideological issues and debates of
the western world, while the political landscape
is far from homogeneous around the globe. (Hud-
son, 1978) 3) There are several criticisms of the
political compass test: unclear scoring schema, lib-
ertarian bias, and vague statement formulation (Ut-
ley, 2001; Mitchell, 2007). However, we present
a general methodology to probe the political lean-
ing of LMs that is compatible with any ideological
theories, tests, and questionnaires. We encourage
readers to use our approach along with other ideo-
logical theories and tests for a more well-rounded
evaluation.
Probing Language Models For encoder-based
language models, our approach of mask in-filling
is widely adopted in numerous existing works
(Petroni et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022). For language
generation models, we curate prompts, conduct
prompted text generation, and employ a BART-
based stance detector for response evaluation. An
alternative approach would be to explicitly frame
it as a multi-choice question in the prompt, forc-
ing pretrained language models to choose from
STRONG AGREE ,AGREE ,DISAGREE , and STRONG
DISAGREE . These two approaches have their re-
spective pros and cons: our approach is compatible
with all LMs that support text generation and is
more interpretable, while the response mapping and
the stance detector could be more subjective and
rely on empirical hyperparameter settings; multi-
choice questions offer direct and unequivocal an-
swers, while being less interpretable and does not
work well with LMs with fewer parameters such as
GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019).
Fine-Grained Political Leaning Analysis In
this work, we "force" each pretrained LM into its
position on a two-dimensional space based on theirresponses to social and economic issues. However,
political leaning could be more fine-grained than
two numerical values: being liberal on one issue
does not necessarily exclude the possibility of be-
ing conservative on another, and vice versa. We
leave it to future work on how to achieve a more
fine-grained understanding of LM political leaning
in a topic- and issue-specific manner.
Ethics Statement
U.S.-Centric Perspectives The authors of this
work are based in the U.S., and our framing in this
work, e.g., references to minority identity groups,
reflects this context. This viewpoint is not univer-
sally applicable and may vary in different contexts
and cultures.
Misuse Potential In this paper, we showed that
hyperpartisan LMs are not simply achieved by pre-
training on more partisan data for more epochs.
However, this preliminary finding does not exclude
the possibility of future malicious attempts at cre-
ating hyperpartisan language models, and some
might even succeed. Training and employing hyper-
partisan LMs might contribute to many malicious
purposes, such as propagating partisan misinforma-
tion or adversarially attacking pretrained language
models (Bagdasaryan and Shmatikov, 2022). We
will refrain from releasing the trained hyperparti-
san language model checkpoints and will establish
access permission for the collected partisan pre-
training corpora to ensure its research-only usage.
Interpreting Downstream Task Performance
While we showed that pretrained LMs with dif-
ferent political leanings could have different perfor-
mances and behaviors on downstream tasks, this
empirical evidence should not be taken as a judg-
ment of individuals and communities with certain
political leanings, rather than a mere reflection of
the empirical behavior of pretrained LMs.
Authors’ Political Leaning Although the au-
thors strive to conduct politically impartial analysis
throughout the paper, it is not impossible that our
inherent political leaning has impacted experiment
interpretation and analysis in unperceived ways.
We encourage the readers to also examine the mod-
els and results by themselves, or at least be aware
of this possibility.Acknowledgements

A Probing Language Models (cont.)
A.1 Encoder-Based LMs
We used mask filling to probe the political leaning
of encoder-based language models (e.g. BERT (De-
vlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019)).
Specifically, we retrieve the top-10 probable token
for mask filling, aggregate the probability of posi-
tive and negative words, and set a threshold to map
them to {STRONG DISAGREE ,DISAGREE ,AGREE ,
STRONG AGREE }. A complete list of positive and
negative words adopted is presented in Table 7,
which is obtained after manually examining the
output probabilities of 100 examples. We then com-
pare the probability of positive words and negative
words to settle AGREE v.s. DISAGREEE , then nor-
malize and use 0.3 in probability difference as a
threshold for whether that response is STRONGLY
or not.
A.2 Decoder-Based LMs
We use prompted text generation and a stance de-
tector to evaluate the political leaning of decoder-
based language models (e.g. GPT-2 (Radford et al.,
2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)). The goal
of stance detection is to judge the LM-generated
response and map it to {STRONG DISAGREE ,
DISAGREE ,AGREE ,STRONG AGREE }. To this end,
we employed the FACEBOOK /BART -LARGE -MNLI
checkpoint on Huggingface Transformers, which
is BART (Lewis et al., 2019) fine-tuned on the
multiNLI dataset (Williams et al., 2018), to initial-
ize a zero-shot classification pipeline of AGREE
and DISAGREE , evaluating whether the response
entails agreement or disagreement. We further con-
duct a human evaluation of the stance detector: weselect 110 LM-generated responses, annotate the re-
sponses, and compare the human annotations with
the results of the stance detector. The three anno-
tators are graduate students in the U.S., with prior
knowledge both in NLP and U.S. politics. This
human evaluation answers a few key questions:
•Do language models provide clear responses to
political propositions? Yes, since 80 of the 110
LM responses provide responses with a clear
stance. The Fleiss’ Kappa of annotation agree-
ment is 0.85, which signals strong agreement
among annotators regarding the stance of LM
responses.
•Is the stance detector accurate? Yes, on the 80
LM responses with a clear stance, the BART-
based stance detector has an accuracy of 97%.
This indicates that the stance detector is reliable
in judging the agreement of LM-generated re-
sponses.
•How do we deal with unclear LM responses?
We observed that the 30 unclear responses have
an average stance detection confidence of 0.76,
while the 80 unclear responses have an average
confidence of 0.90. This indicates that the stance
detector’s confidence could serve as a heuristic
to filter out unclear responses. As a result, we re-
trieve the top-10 probable LM responses, remove
the ones with lower than 0.9 confidence, and ag-
gregate the scores of the remaining responses.
To sum up, we present a reliable framework to
probe the political leaning of pretrained language
models. We commit to making the code and data
publicly available upon acceptance to facilitate the
evaluation of new and emerging LMs.
B Recall and Precision
Following previous works (Sap et al., 2019), we ad-
ditionally report false positives and false negatives
through precision and recall in Table 12.
C Experiment Details
We provide details about specific language model
checkpoints used in this work in Table 10. We
present the dataset statistics for the social media
corpora in Table 8, while we refer readers to Liu
et al. (2022b) for the statistics of the news media
corpora.Leaning Size avg. # token Pre/Post-Trump

D Stability Analysis
Pretrained language models are sensitive to minor
changes and perturbations in the input text (Li et al.,
2021; Wang et al.), which may in turn lead to in-
stability in the political leaning measuring process.
In the experiments, we made minor edits to the
prompt formulation in order to best elicit politi-
cal opinions of diverse language models. We fur-
ther examine whether the political opinion of lan-
guage models stays stable in the face of changes in
prompts and political statements. Specifically, we
design 6 more prompts to investigate the sensitivity
toward prompts. We similarly use 6 paraphrasing
models to paraphrase the political propositions and
investigate the sensitivity towards paraphrasing. We
present the results of four LMs in Figure 5, which
illustrates that GPT-3 DaVinci (Brown et al., 2020)
provides the most consistent responses, while the
political opinions of all pretrained LMs are moder-
ately stable.
We further evaluate the stability of LM political
leaning with respect to minor changes in prompts.
We write 7 different prompts formats, prompt LMs
separately, and present the results in Figure 6. It
is demonstrated that GPT-3 DaVinci provides the
most consistent responses towards prompt changes,
while the political opinions of all pretrained LMs
are moderately stable.
For paraphrasing, we adopted three mod-
els: VAMSI /T5_P ARAPHRASE _PAWS based on

Table 10: Details about which language model checkpoints are adopted in this work.
PARAPHRASE based on BART (Lewis et al., 2019),
TUNER 007/ PEGASUS _PARAPHRASE based on PE-
GASUS (Zhang et al., 2020), and three online para-
phrasing tools: Quill Bot9, Edit Pad10, and Para-
phraser11. For prompts, we present the 7 manually
designed prompts in Table 11.
E Qualitative Analysis (cont.)
We conduct qualitative analysis and present more
hate speech examples where pretrained LMs with
different political leanings beg to differ. Table 14
presents more examples for hate speech detection.
It is demonstrated that pretrained LMs with differ-
ent political leanings dohave vastly different behav-
ior facing hate speech targeting different identities.
F Hyperparameter Settings
We further pretrained LM checkpoints on partisan
corpora and fine-tuned them on downstream tasks.
We present hyperparameters for the pretraining and
fine-tuning stage in Table 9. We mostly follow the
hyperparameters in Gururangan et al. (2020) for
the pretraining stage. The default hyperparameters
on Huggingface Transformers are adopted if not
included in Table 9.
G Computational Resources
We used a GPU cluster with 16 NVIDIA A40
GPUs, 1988G memory, and 104 CPU cores for
the experiments. Pretraining ROBERTA -BASE and
GPT-2 on the partisan pretraining corpora takes
9https://quillbot.com/
10https://www.editpad.org/
11https://www.paraphraser.io/approximately 48 and 83 hours. Fine-tuning the par-
tisan LMs takes approximately 30 and 20 minutes
for the hate speech detection and misinformation
identification datasets.
H Scientific Artifacts
We leveraged many open-source scientific arti-
facts in this work, including pytorch (Paszke et al.,
2019), pytorch lightning (Falcon and The PyTorch
Lightning team, 2019), HuggingFace transformers
(Wolf et al., 2020), sklearn (Pedregosa et al., 2011),
NumPy (Harris et al., 2020), NLTK (Bird et al.,
2009), and the PushShift API12. We commit to
making our code and data publicly available upon
acceptance to facilitate reproduction and further
research.
