It involves working closely with a faculty advisor to conduct original research in a specific area of language technologies, such as natural language processing, machine learning, or computational linguistics. The directed research component allows students to gain hands-on experience in conducting research and developing innovative solutions in the field of language technologies. Through this experience, students can develop their research skills, learn how to work independently and collaboratively, and gain a deeper understanding of the field. The directed research component is an integral part of the MLT program and is typically completed during the academic year, with students devoting at least 20 hours per week to their research project.\n","6.

Tartan is a specific type of plaid that originated in Scotland. Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design, while plaid is a broader term that can refer to any fabric with a similar pattern. Tartan is made up of bands of color that cross over each other in a specific way, creating a unique checkerboard pattern. Plaid, on the other hand, can refer to any type of fabric with a similar pattern, regardless of its origin or construction.

It is a race where teams of students build and drive slick, torpedo-like vessels called buggies around a .84-mile course in Schenley Park. The race is a Spring Carnival treat and requires a lot of planning and effort from the teams involved. The buggies are made up of a body, pushbar, wheels, a safety harness, and driving and braking mechanisms. The teams also have a reputation of being secretive about how they build their buggies, but they are required to have certain features such as a body, pushbar, wheels, and driving and braking mechanisms. The drivers are also required to wear safety gear such as a mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves, and a helmet. The race is a fun event for students and spectators alike, and it is a great way for students to showcase their engineering skills and creativity.\n","2.
