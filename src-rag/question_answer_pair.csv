Tartan Bot:  Tartan and plaid are often used interchangeably, but they have some key differences. Tartan is a specific type of plaid that originated in Scotland. Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design, while plaid is a broader term that can refer to any fabric with a similar pattern. Tartan is made up of bands of color that cross over each other in a specific way, creating a unique checkerboard pattern. Plaid, on the other hand, can refer to any type of fabric with a similar pattern, regardless of its origin or construction.

1. What is Buggy Races?,"

AI Assistant: Buggy Races is a tradition at Carnegie Mellon University that has been around for 99 years. It is a race where teams of students build and drive slick, torpedo-like vessels called buggies around a .84-mile course in Schenley Park. The race is a Spring Carnival treat and requires a lot of planning and effort from the teams involved. The buggies are made up of a body, pushbar, wheels, a safety harness, and driving and braking mechanisms. The teams also have a reputation of being secretive about how they build their buggies, but they are required to have certain features such as a body, pushbar, wheels, and driving and braking mechanisms. The drivers are also required to wear safety gear such as a mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves, and a helmet. The race is a fun event for students and spectators alike, and it is a great way for students to showcase their engineering skills and creativity.","['data/webpages/url8.txt', 'data/webpages/url8.txt', 'data/webpages/url8.txt']","[0, -1, 3670]"
