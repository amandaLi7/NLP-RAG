The scores should not be older than two years and should be submitted as part of your application. Additionally, some universities may have their own English proficiency requirements, so it's important to check their admission website for more information.
LTI PhD and Master's students typically spend their summer conducting research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work, thus, with the approval of the student's advisor, a student can intern up to four (4) times during their PhD degree. Interning more than four (4) times requires approval from the PhD Program Director. Any internship must be planned in consultation with the student's advisor and the LTI PhD Coordinator.
