The first two years of the Ph.D. program are similar to our MLT program. After the second year, you will spend most of your time working closely with your faculty advisor on research that advances the state-of-the-art in computer science. Ph.D. students are expected to publish papers about original research in the most competitive scientific journals and international conference proceedings, and to present their research at conferences and workshops. Most of our Ph.D. graduates become professors and research scientists, while a few have started their own companies. Requirements In general, students pursuing a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies must Pass at least 96 units of graduate-level courses. Satisfy proficiencies in writing, presentation, programming and teaching; and Propose, write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis). Students must also attend the LTI Colloquium each semester and satisfy our Research Speaking Requirement. For a detailed breakdown of the above requirements, download and read the PhD Handbook . Curriculum In order to obtain your Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies, you need to pass 96 units (generally, eight courses) of graduate courses that fulfill these requirements: At least 72 units of LTI courses: Must include one class in each LTI focus area.\n","\n","At least 24 units of SCS courses. At least two lab courses in two different research areas. Here's a sample of what your five-year schedule might look like.
