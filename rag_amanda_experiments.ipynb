The first two years of the Ph.D. program are similar to our MLT program. After the second year, you will spend most of your time working closely with your faculty advisor on research that advances the state-of-the-art in computer science. Ph.D. students are expected to publish papers about original research in the most competitive scientific journals and international conference proceedings, and to present their research at conferences and workshops. Most of our Ph.D. graduates become professors and research scientists, while a few have started their own companies. Requirements In general, students pursuing a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies must Pass at least 96 units of graduate-level courses. Satisfy proficiencies in writing, presentation, programming and teaching; and Propose, write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis). Students must also attend the LTI Colloquium each semester and satisfy our Research Speaking Requirement. For a detailed breakdown of the above requirements, download and read the PhD Handbook .

            "Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Overview The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation. Requirements The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor. MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course).\n",
            "\n",
            "This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers indepth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: Human Language for Language Technologies Language Technology Application Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part-time education option is available in some cases. MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements. For a full list of requirements, read the MIIS Handbook . Curriculum Here are some example schedules for completing the MIIS-16 program. Example Course of Study #1 This schedule would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in text mining, text analytics and question-answering systems.\n",
