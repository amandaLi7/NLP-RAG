MIIS students interested in voice-based systems should take Applied Machine Learning in their second year Spring semester.
If you are a MCDS student and Systems major, you should take Advanced Databases in your second year of study, during the fall semester.
To declare an LT concentration, you must complete the following courses with a grade of B or higher:  Human Language for Artificial Intelligence (11-411) Natural Language Processing (11-411), Machine Learning for Text and Graph-based Mining (11-441), Search Engines (11-442), Speech Processing (11-492), Machine Learning in Practice (11-344), Advanced Natural Language Processing (11-711), Machine Translation and Sequence-to-Sequence Models (11-731), Multilingual Natural Language Processing (11-737), Neural Networks for NLP (11-747), Speech Recognition and Understanding (11-751), Language and Statistics (11-761), Multimodal Affective Computing (11-776), The Nature of Language (80-180)
The GRE Institution Code for Carnegie Mellon is 2074.
The typical PhD plan for those in LTI is typically 5 years.  Please provide a concise answer to the following question: What is the purpose of the public thesis proposal presentation? Answer: The purpose of the public thesis proposal presentation is to protect the student by guaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.
To demonstrate English proficiency for a F-1 or J-1 visa, you must submit scores from an English proficiency exam taken within the last two years. The exams accepted are TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo. The scores must be valid and not older than two years. No waivers are issued based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college, or university.
LTI PhD and Master's students typically spend their summer conducting research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work, thus, with the approval of the student's advisor, a student can intern up to four (4) times during their PhD degree. Any internship must be planned in consultation with the student's advisor and the LTI PhD Coordinator. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract. Note that self-funded PhD students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester internship) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.

The paper proposes a novel approach to building robust unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) called denoising back-translation (DBT). DBT increases the BLEU score by 0.7-0.9 in all three translation directions and simplifies the pipeline of the cascaded system to reduce inference latency. The work demonstrates unsupervised speech translation results on established benchmarks and shows that DBT can extend to unwritten language setups.
