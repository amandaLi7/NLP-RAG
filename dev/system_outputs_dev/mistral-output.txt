11 -928 Masters Thesis I and 11 -929 Masters Thesis II. These courses count towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, with the second course (11 -929) counting towards one PhD lab requirement. The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their advisor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in a publication-quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research significance. The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor and two additional readers, at least two of whom must be SCS faculty working in Language Technologies. To receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared a written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the next semester.

The paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation' proposes a novel approach to building a robust unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) system using denoising back-translation (DBT). The DBT method combines denoising autoencoding and back-translation to deal with error propagation issues in a fully unsupervised fashion. The paper also simplifies the pipeline of the cascaded system by normalizing the output of the UASR and using a text detokenizer to reconstruct unnormalized text, which reduces inference time. The results show that DBT substantially increases the quality of the cascaded unsupervised speech translation system.
