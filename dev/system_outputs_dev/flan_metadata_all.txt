low number of unique values of reciprocal rank means that, especially when evaluating multiple highly-performing systems, we are likely to observe tied performance.
We keep the language model frozen, and finetune input and output linear layers to enable crossmodality interactions. This allows our model to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs, and generate free-form text interleaved with retrieved images.
