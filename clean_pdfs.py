# author listing at the top of papers is an issue; sometimes people use
# unicode characters or there's other improper formatting. CHECK THIS

# papers written with double columns have a lot of new lines and words
# that are hyphenated because theyre cut off by new lines. CHECK THIS

# consider checking if a number is bounded on both sides by alpha characters,
# if so then separate with spaces
