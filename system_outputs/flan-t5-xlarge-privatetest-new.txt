Increased focus on the computational efficiency of NLP systems has motivated the design of efficient model architectures and improvements to underlying hardware accelerators. However, the resulting increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations have not directly translated to improvements in wall-clock inference latency. We demonstrate that these discrepancies can be largely attributed to bottlenecks introduced by deep learning frameworks. We denote this phenomenon as the <unk> textit<unk>frame

Using unigrams during MinHash calculation leads to many false positives, around 20% at 0.85. Increasing the n-gram size reduces false positives, but also increases false negatives. This is an expected trade-off between precision and recall; 2) A lower threshold would cause more documents to be removed at the cost of processing time. In our experiments, we have observed good duplicates occur with a similarity as low as 0.65, even though

We propose an efficient method to ground pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain, enabling them to process and generate arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text data. Our method leverages the abilities of language models learnt from large scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. We keep the language model frozen, and finetune input and output linear layers to enable cross-modality

We also nd that the usage of a highly-weighted ToM listener leads to signi cant uency gains when training on both easy (15.6% relative increase in uency score) and hard (11.6%) distractors. We also see longer and more complex utterances when using normally or highly weighted ToM listeners. Additionally, we nd limited gains in general captioning ability between baseline and high-weight models, as measured
