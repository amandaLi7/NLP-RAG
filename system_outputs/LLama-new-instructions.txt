The three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs are:     1. Using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens, which can recover 55% of the performance without retrieval.     2. Approximate kNN search allows kNN-LMs to generalize better than exact nearest neighbor search, possibly due to a regularization effect.     3. Tuning the softmax temperature for the kNN distribution is crucial to adjust the standard LM output distribution with the distribution created by the retrieved neighbors' distances.

In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer.

The mapping network in the proposed model in "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" plays a crucial role in fusing the frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models. The mapping network translates the hidden representations of the LLM into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling the model to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs. In other words, the mapping network maps the output representations of the frozen LLM to the input space of GILLMapper, allowing the model to generate images from text inputs. This enables the model to generate images that are conditioned on arbitrary interleaved image and text inputs, and produce retrieved images, generated images, and generated text that outperform non-LLM based generation models across several text-to-image tasks.

According to the paper "Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models", diffusion models have vulnerabilities related to memorization and data regeneration. The paper shows that these models can memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time, potentially compromising privacy. The authors also demonstrate that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.
