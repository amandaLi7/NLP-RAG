FLARE is a method for active retrieval augmented generation that iteratively generates a temporary next sentence and uses it as a query to retrieve relevant documents if it contains low-probability tokens. It is applicable to any existing LMs at inference time without additional training. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance compared to single-time and multi-time retrieval baselines on four diverse tasks/datasets involving generating long outputs. The benefit of FLARE over existing retrieval augmented LMs is that it allows for active information access during long-form generation, which is essential in more general scenarios.

Self-Refine uses a model M to provide feedback and refine the initial output. The feedback is generated by prompting the model with a task-specific prompt pfb that provides examples of feedback in the form of input-output-feedback triples x(k), y(k), fb(k). The feedback is actionable and specific, containing a concrete action that would likely improve the output and identifying concrete phrases in the output to change. The model then refines its most recent output based on this feedback using a refinement model prefine.

CSurF addresses sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a "bag-of-CSFs". It bridges the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF), which pairs a lexical surface form with a context source and is represented by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms and effectively scores each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring.

Contextual Reasoning about Effects and Harms of Offensive Statements". The paper discusses the importance of reasoning about the social and situational context in which statements are made to understand their harms and offensiveness. The authors create a dataset called COBRA CORPUS, which contains 33,000 potentially offensive statements paired with machine-generated contexts and free-text explanations of offensiveness, implied biases, speaker intents, and listener reactions. The paper also describes a method for generating likely contexts for statements using GPT-3.5, and generating COBRA explanations for each context-statement pair. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance and feasibility of contextualized NLP by modeling social factors.

The paper "Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models" discusses vulnerabilities related to privacy and copyright risks associated with diffusion models. The authors show that diffusion models memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time. They also demonstrate that diffusion models are less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training. The paper suggests that diffusion models could potentially protect the privacy of real images by generating synthetic examples, but this line of work relies on the assumption that diffusion models do not memorize and regenerate their training data.

A Geometry View" is to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. The authors propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, they aim to eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable.

The issue found with reciprocal rank is that it is brittle when discriminating between ranking systems, especially in modern evaluation settings where high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. Additionally, it lacks sensitivity when it comes to discriminating between ranking systems, and its distribution begins to skew toward a higher probability of a tie as the number of relevant items increases.
The proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain involves leveraging the abilities of language models learnt from large scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. The language model is kept frozen, and input and output linear layers are finetuned to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows the model to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs and generate free-form text interleaved with retrieved images. The approach works with any off-the-shelf language model and paves the way towards an effective, general solution for leveraging pretrained language models in visually grounded settings.

This is especially true for easy and hard distractors, where accuracy gains of up to 4.6% and 3.0% are achieved, respectively. Additionally, models trained with a highly weighted ToM listener component generate more complex and precise utterances, leading to higher fluency scores.
