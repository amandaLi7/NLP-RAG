Yes, some faculty members have used detector models on machine-generated text in their research. For example, Reza Shokri and his colleagues used a detector model in their paper titled "Smaller Language Models are Better Black-box Machine-Generated Text Detectors" to detect machine-generated text produced by different language models. They found that smaller models are better universal detectors and that partially trained models are better detectors than fully trained ones.

The paper proposes a novel approach called denoising back-translation (DBT) to improve the robustness of unsupervised speech translation systems. DBT combines denoising autoencoding and back-translation techniques to deal with error propagation issues in a fully unsupervised fashion. The proposed method substantially increases the quality of the cascaded unsupervised speech translation system and simplifies the pipeline of the cascaded system by reducing inference latency.
