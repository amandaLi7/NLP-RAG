We proposed denoising back-translation (DBT), a novel approach to building robust unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT). DBT successfully increases the BLEU score by 0.7 0.9 in all three translation directions. Moreover, we simpli ed the pipeline of our cascaded system to reduce inference latency and conducted a comprehensive analysis of every part of our work. We also demonstrate our unsupervised speech translation results on the established Speech translation (

This work crawled the web to construct WebUI, a large dataset of 400,000 rendered web pages associated with automatically extracted metadata, and analyzed the composition of WebUI to show that while automatically extracted data is noisy, most examples meet basic criteria for visual UI modeling.
