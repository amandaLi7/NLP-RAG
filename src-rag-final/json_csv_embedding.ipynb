The shared tasks address 9 scientific challenges in spoken language translation: simultaneous and offline translation, automatic subtitling and dubbing, speech-to-speech translation, multilingual, dialect and low-resource speech translation, and formality control. The shared tasks attracted a total of 38 submissions by 31 teams. The growing interest towards spoken language translation is also witnessed by the constantly increasing number of shared task organizers and contributors to the overview paper, almost evenly distributed across industry and academia.\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN' published?\\nAnswer: International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN'?\\nAnswer: 156\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN' have?\\nAnswer: 22\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN' have?\\nAnswer: 22\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN'?\\nAnswer: https://aclanthology.org/2023.iwslt-1.1.pdf\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN'?\\nAnswer: International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages: 1-61; International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation\\nNotes: ##Title: FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/f7e995c3cae465963ecaa8c9b4ce8b9b4323a71b.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'FINDINGS OF THE IWSLT 2023 EVALUATION CAMPAIGN'?\\nAnswer: Sweta Agrawal, Antonios Anastasopoulos, L.

Some of these formats are human readable; others are machine readable. Some are easy to edit with general-purpose tools. Few represent non-concatentative processes like infixation, reduplication, mutation, truncation, and tonal overwriting in a consistent and formally rigorous way (on par with affixation). We propose an annotation conventionâ€”Generalized Glossing Guidelines (GGG) that combines all of these positive properties using an Item-and-Process (IP) framework. We describe the format, demonstrate its linguistic adequacy, and compare it with two other interlinear glossed text annotation schemes.\\nNotes: ##Title: Generalized Glossing Guidelines: An Explicit,

Automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue systems as an open challenge has been the center of the attention of many researchers. Despite the consistent efforts to improve automatic metrics’ correlations with human evaluation, there have been very few attempts to assess their robustness over multiple domains and dimensions. Also, their focus is mainly on the English language. All of these challenges prompt the development of automatic evaluation metrics that are reliable in various domains, dimensions, and languages. This track in the 11th Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC11) is part of the ongoing effort to promote robust and multilingual automatic evaluation metrics. This article describes the datasets and baselines provided to participants and discusses the submission and result details of the two proposed subtasks.\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4' published?\\nAnswer: DSTC\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4'?\\nAnswer: 71\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4' have?\\nAnswer: 3\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4' have?\\nAnswer: 3\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.12794\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/9799c17fd287bb9e8d231fe032c6dbf9c0c9d675.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nfor Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2306.12794;

abstract of the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals'?\\nAnswer: High sample complexity has long been a challenge for RL. On the other hand, humans learn to perform tasks not only from interaction or demonstrations, but also by reading unstructured text documents, e.g., instruction manuals. Instruction manuals and wiki pages are among the most abundant data that could inform agents of valuable features and policies or task-specific environmental dynamics and reward structures. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ability to utilize human-written instruction manuals to assist learning policies for specific tasks should lead to a more efficient and better-performing agent. We propose the Read and Reward framework. Read and Reward speeds up RL algorithms on Atari games by reading manuals released by the Atari game developers. Our framework consists of a QA Extraction module that extracts and summarizes relevant information from the manual and a Reasoning module that evaluates object-agent interactions based on information from the manual. An auxiliary reward is then provided to a standard A2C RL agent, when interaction is detected. Experimentally, various RL algorithms obtain significant improvement in performance and training speed when assisted by our design.\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals'?\\nAnswer: 72\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals' have?\\nAnswer: 15\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals' have?\\nAnswer: 15\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals' have?\\nAnswer: 3\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals'?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04449\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2302.04449; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/61678a9f1d8291bb0f3d704a439ac8cd64fa6482.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals'?\\nAnswer: Yue Wu, Yewen Fan, P.

the abstract of the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge'?\\nAnswer: This paper describes our submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2), which consists of target speech enhancement for hearing-aid (HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments with multiple interferers such as music and competing speakers. Our approach builds upon the powerful iterative neural/beamforming enhancement (iNeuBe) framework introduced in our recent work, and this paper extends it for target speaker extraction. We therefore name the proposed approach as iNeuBe-X, where the X stands for extraction. To address the challenges encountered in the CEC2 setting, we introduce four major novelties: (1) we extend the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model, originally designed for monaural speaker separation, for multi-channel, causal speech enhancement, and large improvements are observed by replacing the TCNDenseNet used in iNeuBe with this new architecture; (2) we leverage a recent dual window size approach with future-frame prediction to ensure that iNueBe-X satisfies the 5 ms constraint on algorithmic latency required by CEC2; (3) we introduce a novel speaker-conditioning branch for TF-GridNet to achieve target speaker extraction; (4) we propose a fine-tuning step, where we compute an additional loss with respect to the target speaker signal compensated with the listener audiogram. Without using external data, on the official development set our best model reaches a hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) score of 0.942 and a scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SI-SDRi) of 18.8 dB. These results are promising given the fact that the CEC2 data is extremely challenging (e.g., on the development set the mixture SI-SDR is -12.3 dB). A demo of our submitted system is available at WAVLab CEC2 demo.\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge'?\\nAnswer: 14\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge' have?\\nAnswer: 5\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge' have?\\nAnswer: 5\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge'?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07928\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge'?\\nAnswer: Engineering, Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dd5d797b837005fac464bb19b9396bddba61c0d8.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2302.07928;

However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which highfidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs. The first is sampling-invariant content transformation that makes the transformation invariant to the holistic statistics of the sampled 3D points and accordingly ensures multi-view consistency. The second is deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps which is equivalent to the transformation of 3D points but greatly reduces memory footprint without degrading multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.

In this paper, we describe our speech translation system for the multilingual track of IWSLT 2023, which focuses on the translation of scientific conference talks. The test condition features accented input speech and terminology-dense contents. The tasks requires translation into 10 languages of varying amounts of resources. In absence of training data from the target domain, we use a retrieval-based approach (kNN-MT) for effective adaptation (+0.8 BLEU for speech translation). We also use adapters to easily integrate incremental training data from data augmentation, and show that it matches the performance of re-training. We observe that cascaded systems are more easily adaptable towards specific target domains, due to their separate modules. Our cascaded speech system outperforms its end-to-end counterpart on scientific talk translation, although their performance remains similar on TED talks.\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023' published?\\nAnswer: International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023'?\\nAnswer: 41\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05320\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2306.05320; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/610d9958390ab83515d0d81e19f8e5264faf8e9b.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023'?\\nAnswer: Danni Liu, T.

This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF). Each CSF pairs a lexical surface form with a context source, and is represented by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. This framework is able to perform sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a \"bag-of-CSFs\", simultaneously addressing two key factors in sparse retrieval: vocabulary expansion of surface form and semantic representation of term meaning. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, and effectively scores each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring. Multiple experiments show that this approach successfully resolves the main mismatch issues in lexical exact-match retrieval and outperforms state-of-the-art lexical exact-match systems, reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an efficient exact-match-based system.\\nNotes: ##Title: CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms',

In contrast, the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation(OGN) has targeted navigating in indoor environments by leveraging spatial and semantic cues that do not generalize outdoors. While these contributions provide valuable insights into indoor scenarios, the broader spectrum of real-world robotic applications often extends to outdoor settings. As we transition to the vast and complex terrains of outdoor environments, new challenges emerge. Unlike the structured layouts found indoors, outdoor environments lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities. Despite this, humans navigate with ease because we can reason about the unseen. We introduce a new task OUTDOOR, a new mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures, and a new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this more complex domain. Additionally, we show impressive results on both a simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments. Our agent has no premapping and our formalism outperforms naive LLM-based approaches\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation'?\\nAnswer: 36\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10103\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2309.10103; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/8035a247980cb18abf2bb7b9d96e7d4c63622ef2.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation'?\\nAnswer: Quanting Xie, Tianyi Zhang, Kedi Xu, M.

It decomposes the source task into sub goal conditional subtasks and conducts exploration and exploitation in the subgoal space. The effectiveness of GCHRL heavily relies on sub goal representation functions and sub goal selection strategy. However, existing works often overlook the temporal coherence in GCHRL when learning latent sub goal representations and lack an efficient sub goal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. This paper proposes HIerarchical reinforcement learning via dynamically building Latent Landmark graphs (HILL) to overcome these limitations. HILL learns latent subgoal representations that satisfy temporal coherence using a contrastive representation learning objective. Based on these representations, HILL dynamically builds latent landmark graphs and employs a novelty measure on nodes and a utility measure on edges. Finally, HILL develops a subgoal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation by jointly considering both measures. Experimental results demonstrate that HILL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on continuous control tasks with sparse rewards in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.

abstract of the paper 'FNeural Speech Enhancement with Very Low Algorithmic Latency and Complexity via Integrated full- and sub-band Modeling'?\\nAnswer: We propose FSB-LSTM, a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) based architecture that integrates full- and sub-band (FSB) modeling, for single- and multi-channel speech enhancement in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. The model maintains an information highway to flow an over-complete input representation through multiple FSB-LSTM modules. Each FSB-LSTM module consists of a full-band block to model spectro-temporal patterns at all frequencies and a sub-band block to model patterns within each sub-band, where each of the two blocks takes a down-sampled representation as input and returns an up-sampled discriminative representation to be added to the block input via a residual connection. The model is designed to have a low algorithmic complexity, a small run-time buffer and a very low algorithmic latency, at the same time producing a strong enhancement performance on a noisy-reverberant speech enhancement task even if the hop size is as low as 2 ms.\\nNotes: ##Title: FNeural Speech Enhancement with Very Low Algorithmic Latency and Complexity via Integrated full- and

A number of apps are published in both stores, offering us the opportunity to compare their privacy label disclosures in the two app stores. This paper compares the data practices privacy labels are intended to capture in each store. It then proceeds to analyze the disclosures of 822 apps published in both app stores, focusing on possible discrepancies. This analysis reveals that privacy label disclosures of what is ostensibly the same mobile app can be quite different. We discuss the different possible reasons behind these differences, including the possibility that these discrepancies might be indicative of potential privacy compliance issues. In particular, focusing on data collection disclosures of five different data types (location, contact info, sensitive info, identifiers, and health & fitness) we find discrepancies between iOS and Google Play privacy label disclosures in 66.5% of the mobile apps we analyze.\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores' published?\\nAnswer: 2023 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW)\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores'?\\nAnswer: 26\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores'?\\nAnswer: https://oa.upm.es/75608/1/Final_Submission_Article.pdf\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/88efd1663016c4170674c8f30067e7096b172598.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Comparing Privacy Label Disclosures of Apps Published in both the App Store and Google Play Stores'?\\nAnswer: 2023 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW), pages: 150-157;

This work provides an insightful investigation of speech separation in reverberant and noisy-reverberant scenarios as an ASR front-end. In detail, we explore multi-channel separation methods, mask-based beamforming and complex spectral mapping, as well as the best features to use in the ASR back-end model. We employ the recent self-supervised learning representation (SSLR) as a feature and improve the recognition performance from the case with filterbank features. To further improve multi-speaker recognition performance, we present a carefully designed training strategy for integrating speech separation and recognition with SSLR.

In this paper, we perform a comparative study of how humans annotate two categorizations of multimodal interactions: (1) partial labels, where different annotators annotate the label given the first, second, and both modalities, and (2) counterfactual labels, where the same annotator annotates the label given the first modality before asking them to explicitly reason about how their answer changes when given the second. We further propose an alternative taxonomy based on (3) information decomposition, where annotators annotate the degrees of redundancy: the extent to which modalities individually and together give the same predictions, uniqueness: the extent to which one modality enables a prediction that the other does not, and synergy: the extent to which both modalities enable one to make a prediction that one would not otherwise make using individual modalities. Through experiments and annotations, we highlight several opportunities and limitations of each approach and propose a method to automatically convert annotations of partial and counterfactual labels to information decomposition, yielding an accurate and efficient method for quantifying multimodal interactions.\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification' published?\\nAnswer: International Conference on Multimodal Interaction\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification'?\\nAnswer: 79\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification'?\\nAnswer: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3577190.3614151\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification'?\\nAnswer: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction\\nNotes: ##Title: Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/90b09bdb1bd78875ee8d8d324a568a36955e4765.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification'?\\nAnswer: P.

The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviors. These elements are processed into a vector representation of the previous turns, which serves as input to several machine learning models, including MLP and LSTM. The results show that embedding layers, capturing the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model’s performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors, in predicting hedges by using Shapley values for feature explanation. We discover that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction.

Existing Self-Consistency techniques always generate a constant number of samples per question, where a better approach will be to non-uniformly distribute the available budget based on the amount of agreement in the samples generated so far. In response, we introduce Adaptive-Consistency, a cost-efficient, model-agnostic technique that dynamically adjusts the number of samples per question using a lightweight stopping criterion. Our experiments over 17 reasoning and code generation datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that Adaptive-Consistency reduces sample budget by up to 7.9 times with an average accuracy drop of less than 0.1%.

abstract of the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora'?\\nAnswer: Designing effective automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Code-Switching (CS) often depends on the availability of the transcribed CS resources. To address data scarcity, this paper introduces Speech Collage, a method that synthesizes CS data from monolingual corpora by splicing audio segments. We further improve the smoothness quality of audio generation using an overlap-add approach. We investigate the impact of generated data on speech recognition in two scenarios: using in-domain CS text and a zero-shot approach with synthesized CS text. Empirical results highlight up to 34.4% and 16.2% relative reductions in Mixed-Error Rate and Word-Error Rate for in-domain and zero-shot scenarios, respectively. Lastly, we demonstrate that CS augmentation bolsters the model's code-switching inclination and reduces its monolingual bias.\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora'?\\nAnswer: 40\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15674\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science, Engineering\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2309.15674; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/fa5ebb425c57f6c4f1c36a7200ef1da867346e8c.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora'?\\nAnswer: A.

However, this paradigm can lead to models that generate toxic, inaccurate, and unhelpful content, and automatic evaluation metrics often fail to identify these behaviors. As models become more capable, human feedback is an invaluable signal for evaluating and improving models. This survey aims to provide an overview of the recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation. First, we introduce an encompassing formalization of feedback, and identify and organize existing research into a taxonomy following this formalization. Next, we discuss how feedback can be described by its format and objective, and cover the two approaches proposed to use feedback (either for training or decoding): directly using the feedback or training feedback models. We also discuss existing datasets for human-feedback data collection, and concerns surrounding feedback collection. Finally, we provide an overview of the nascent field of AI feedback, which exploits large language models to make judgments based on a set of principles and minimize the need for human intervention.\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation'?\\nAnswer: 155\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation' have?\\nAnswer: 23\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation' have?\\nAnswer: 23\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation' have?\\nAnswer: 7\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation'?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00955\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2305.00955; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/74b05bba46db21e589a2cc0f916f81069b0368ef.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Bridging the Gap: A Survey on Integrating (Human) Feedback for Natural Language Generation'?\\nAnswer: Patrick Fernandes, Aman Madaan, Emmy Liu, Antonio Farinhas, Pedro Henrique Martins, Amanda Bertsch, Jose G.

In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains.\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical'?\\nAnswer: 72\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05674\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2310.05674; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/a815c3209e7baff4466dbf6e129129511f842b7e.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical'?\\nAnswer: Sang Keun Choe, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, Hwijeen Ahn, W.

To tackle this issue, we propose to build a cascaded speech translation system without leveraging any kind of paired data. We use fully unpaired data to train our unsupervised systems and evaluate our results on CoVoST 2 and CVSS. The results show that our work is comparable with some other early supervised methods in some language pairs. While cascaded systems always suffer from severe error propagation problems, we proposed denoising back-translation (DBT), a novel approach to building robust unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT). DBT successfully increases the BLEU score by 0.7--0.9 in all three translation directions. Moreover, we simplified the pipeline of our cascaded system to reduce inference latency and conducted a comprehensive analysis of every part of our work. We also demonstrate our unsupervised speech translation results on the established website.\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation'?\\nAnswer: 44\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation' have?\\nAnswer: 3\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation' have?\\nAnswer: 3\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation'?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07455\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science, Engineering\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ef8b095292a8e38e9b8f56c54cbf3c67c3ed425d.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Improving Cascaded Unsupervised Speech Translation with Denoising Back-translation'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2305.07455;

Recent work introduced LUMEN, a memory-retrieval hybrid that partially pre-computes memory and updates memory representations on the fly with a smaller live encoder. We propose GLIMMER, which improves on this approach through 1) exploiting free access to the powerful memory representations by applying a shallow reranker on top of memory to drastically improve retrieval quality at low cost, and 2) incorporating multi-task training to learn a general and higher quality memory and live encoder.

Tokenization in the Era of Commercial Language Models'?\\nAnswer: Language models have graduated from being research prototypes to commercialized products offered as web APIs, and recent works have highlighted the multilingual capabilities of these products. The API vendors charge their users based on usage, more specifically on the number of ``tokens'' processed or generated by the underlying language models. What constitutes a token, however, is training data and model dependent with a large variance in the number of tokens required to convey the same information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non-uniformity on the fairness of an API's pricing policy across languages. We conduct a systematic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI's language model API on multilingual benchmarks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large number of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speakers tend to also come from regions where the APIs are less affordable to begin with. Through these analyses, we aim to increase transparency around language model APIs' pricing policies and encourage the vendors to make them more equitable.\\nNotes: ##Title: Do All Languages Cost the Same?

We present a novel system for the Dialogue2Note Medical Summarization tasks in the MEDIQA 2023 Shared Task. Our approach for sectionwise summarization (Task A) is a two-stage process of selecting semantically similar dialogues and using the top-k similar dialogues as in-context examples for GPT-4. For full-note summarization (Task B), we use a similar solution with k=1. We achieved 3rd place in Task A (2nd among all teams), 4th place in Task B Division Wise Summarization (2nd among all teams), 15th place in Task A Section Header Classification (9th among all teams), and 8th place among all teams in Task B. Our results highlight the effectiveness of few-shot prompting for this task, though we also identify several weaknesses of prompting-based approaches. We compare GPT-4 performance with several finetuned baselines. We find that GPT-4 summaries are more abstractive and shorter. We make our code publicly available.\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization' published?\\nAnswer: Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization'?\\nAnswer: 48\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization' have?\\nAnswer: 4\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization' have?\\nAnswer: 4\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization'?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17384\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization'?\\nAnswer: Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop, pages: 490-502; Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop\\nNotes: ##Title: SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb3d299213bae89b5d302cc3dfc36573ec83956.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'SummQA at MEDIQA-Chat 2023: In-Context Learning with GPT-4 for Medical Summarization'?\\nAnswer: Yash Mathur, Sanketh Rangreji, Raghav Kapoor, Medha Palavalli, Amanda Bertsch, Matthew R.

To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucial component is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discrete tokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks.\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation'?\\nAnswer: 79\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation' have?\\nAnswer: 12\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation' have?\\nAnswer: 12\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05737\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2310.05737; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/985f0c89c5a607742ec43c1fdc2cbfe54541cbad.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation'?\\nAnswer: Lijun Yu, Jos'e Lezama, Nitesh B.

However, this process is expensive, since a new expert model must be learned for each subject. In this paper, we present SuTI, a Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that replaces subject-specific fine tuning with in-context learning. Given a few demonstrations of a new subject, SuTI can instantly generate novel renditions of the subject in different scenes, without any subject-specific optimization. SuTI is powered by apprenticeship learning, where a single apprentice model is learned from data generated by a massive number of subject-specific expert models. Specifically, we mine millions of image clusters from the Internet, each centered around a specific visual subject. We adopt these clusters to train a massive number of expert models, each specializing in a different subject. The apprentice model SuTI then learns to imitate the behavior of these fine-tuned experts. SuTI can generate high-quality and customized subject-specific images 20x faster than optimization-based SoTA methods. On the challenging DreamBench and DreamBench-v2, our human evaluation shows that SuTI significantly outperforms existing models like InstructPix2Pix, Textual Inversion, Imagic, Prompt2Prompt, Re-Imagen and DreamBooth, especially on the subject and text alignment aspects.\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning'?\\nAnswer: 44\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning' have?\\nAnswer: 55\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning' have?\\nAnswer: 55\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning' have?\\nAnswer: 6\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.00186\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2304.00186; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/83b8e18488d8f31dd017ec0b26531cef4b635b36.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning'?\\nAnswer: Wenhu Chen, Hexiang Hu, Yandong Li, Nataniel Rui, Xuhui Jia, Ming-Wei Chang, William W.

Many of these systems do not reveal generation parameters. In this paper, we present methods to reverse-engineer the decoding method used to generate text (i.e., top-_k_ or nucleus sampling). Our ability to discover which decoding strategy was used has implications for detecting generated text. Additionally, the process of discovering the decoding strategy can reveal biases caused by selecting decoding settings which severely truncate a model’s predicted distributions. We perform our attack on several families of open-source language models, as well as on production systems (e.g., ChatGPT).\\nNotes: ##Title: Reverse-Engineering Decoding Strategies Given Blackbox

Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction'?\\nAnswer: Previous Multimodal Information based Speech Processing (MISP) challenges mainly focused on audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) with commendable success. However, the most advanced back-end recognition systems often hit performance limits due to the complex acoustic environments. This has prompted a shift in focus towards the Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction (AVTSE) task for the MISP 2023 challenge in ICASSP 2024 Signal Processing Grand Challenges. Unlike existing audio-visual speech enhance-ment challenges primarily focused on simulation data, the MISP 2023 challenge uniquely explores how front-end speech processing, combined with visual clues, impacts back-end tasks in real-world scenarios. This pioneering effort aims to set the first benchmark for the AVTSE task, offering fresh insights into enhancing the ac-curacy of back-end speech recognition systems through AVTSE in challenging and real acoustic environments. This paper delivers a thorough overview of the task setting, dataset, and baseline system of the MISP 2023 challenge. It also includes an in-depth analysis of the challenges participants may encounter. The experimental results highlight the demanding nature of this task, and we look forward to the innovative solutions participants will bring forward.\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction'?\\nAnswer: 26\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08348\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction'?\\nAnswer: Engineering, Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c823c04a6488673f936d72906130f170017288d0.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2309.08348;

End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization'?\\nAnswer: Incorporating longer context has been shown to benefit machine translation, but the inclusion of context in end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST) remains under-studied. To bridge this gap, we introduce target language context in E2E-ST, enhancing coherence and overcoming memory constraints of extended audio segments. Additionally, we propose context dropout to ensure robustness to the absence of context, and further improve performance by adding speaker information. Our proposed contextual E2E-ST outperforms the isolated utterance-based E2E-ST approach. Lastly, we demonstrate that in conversational speech, contextual information primarily contributes to capturing context style, as well as resolving anaphora and named entities.\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization'?\\nAnswer: 38\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15686\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science, Engineering\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2309.15686; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/c2745e86ecc9bec372690cced53ccfdf44f407f8.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Enhancing End-to-End Conversational Speech Translation Through Target Language Context Utilization'?\\nAnswer: A.

We propose an adversarial masked contrastive painting (AMCP) process, which creates a contrast between the original image and a painted image in which a masked area is painted using off-the-shelf generative models. During the painting process, inpainting and outpainting are alternated, with the former masking the foreground and filling in the background, and the latter masking the background while recovering the missing part of the foreground object. Inpainting and outpainting, also referred to as I-step and O-step, allow our method to gradually advance the target segmentation mask toward the ground truth without supervision or training. PaintSeg can be configured to work with a variety of prompts, e.g. coarse masks, boxes, scribbles, and points. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaintSeg outperforms existing approaches in coarse mask-prompt, box-prompt, and point-prompt segmentation tasks, providing a training-free solution suitable for unsupervised segmentation.\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting'?\\nAnswer: 70\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting'?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19406\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2305.19406; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/dc157eba8bdb4cfe6ee65566d8295939ac5b4b37.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'PaintSeg: Training-free Segmentation via Painting'?\\nAnswer: Xiang Li, Chung-Ching Lin, Yinpeng Chen, Zicheng Liu, Jinglu Wang, B.

Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs’ MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world’s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language’s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT’s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages' published?\\nAnswer: Conference on Machine Translation\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages'?\\nAnswer: 24\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages'?\\nAnswer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07423\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2309.07423; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/11a571eaab42a6ffb1d938635a093315e392756d.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages'?\\nAnswer: Nathaniel R.

High-dimensional speech features such as spectrograms are often used as the input for the subsequent model. However, they can still be redundant. Recent investigations proposed the use of discrete speech units derived from self-supervised learning representations, which significantly compresses the size of speech data. Applying various methods, such as de-duplication and subword modeling, can further compress the speech sequence length. Hence, training time is significantly reduced while retaining notable performance. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive and systematic exploration into the application of discrete units within end-to-end speech processing models. Experiments on 12 automatic speech recognition, 3 speech translation, and 1 spoken language understanding corpora demonstrate that discrete units achieve reasonably good results in almost all the settings. We intend to release our configurations and trained models to foster future research efforts.\\nNotes: ##Title: Exploring Speech Recognition, Translation, and Understanding with Discrete Speech Units:

However, the issue of hallucination has parallelly emerged as a by-product, posing significant concerns. While some recent endeavors have been made to identify and mitigate different types of hallucination, there has been a limited emphasis on the nuanced categorization of hallucination and associated mitigation methods. To address this gap, we offer a fine-grained discourse on profiling hallucination based on its degree, orientation, and category, along with offering strategies for alleviation. As such, we define two overarching orientations of hallucination: (i) factual mirage (FM) and (ii) silver lining (SL). To provide a more comprehensive understanding, both orientations are further sub-categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic, with three degrees of severity - (i) mild, (ii) moderate, and (iii) alarming. We also meticulously categorize hallucination into six types: (i) acronym ambiguity, (ii) numeric nuisance, (iii) generated golem, (iv) virtual voice, (v) geographic erratum, and (vi) time wrap. Furthermore, we curate HallucInation eLiciTation (HILT), a publicly available dataset comprising of 75,000 samples generated using 15 contemporary LLMs along with human annotations for the aforementioned categories. Finally, to establish a method for quantifying and to offer a comparative spectrum that allows us to evaluate and rank LLMs based on their vulnerability to producing hallucinations, we propose Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI). We firmly believe that HVI holds significant value as a tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as a rubric in AI-related policy-making. In conclusion, we propose two solution strategies for mitigating hallucinations.\\nNotes: ##Title: The Troubling Emergence of Hallucination in Large Language Models - An Extensive Definition, Quantification, and Prescriptive Remediations\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/99bfe503743c5ec8e16e50ab8438159cdb533a89.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'The Troubling Emergence of Hallucination in Large Language Models -

Datasets have been created in English to accelerate progress towards measuring and improving figurative language processing in language models (LMs). However, the use of figurative language is an expression of our cultural and societal experiences, making it difficult for these phrases to be universally applicable. In this work, we create a figurative language inference dataset, \\\\datasetname, for seven diverse languages associated with a variety of cultures: Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili and Yoruba. Our dataset reveals that each language relies on cultural and regional concepts for figurative expressions, with the highest overlap between languages originating from the same region. We assess multilingual LMs' abilities to interpret figurative language in zero-shot and few-shot settings. All languages exhibit a significant deficiency compared to English, with variations in performance reflecting the availability of pre-training and fine-tuning data, emphasizing the need for LMs to be exposed to a broader range of linguistic and cultural variation during training.\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-lingual and Multi-cultural Figurative Language Understanding\", metadata={'source':

abstract of the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice'?\\nAnswer: Over the past decades, many machine-learning- and artificial-intelligence-based technologies have been created to deduce biometric or bio-relevant parameters of speakers from their voice. These voice profiling technologies have targeted a wide range of parameters, from diseases to environmental factors, based largely on the fact that they are known to influence voice. Recently, some have also explored the prediction of parameters whose influence on voice is not easily observable through data-opportunistic biomarker discovery techniques. However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed.\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice' published?\\nAnswer: Entropy\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice'?\\nAnswer: 82\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice'?\\nAnswer: https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/6/897/pdf?version=1685718244\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice'?\\nAnswer: Medicine, Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/63a4150c9ad87c003de43b32828c8ceec6bb4468.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice'?\\nAnswer: Entropy, volume: 25;

Generated text can be evaluated for fluency, coherence, factuality, or any other dimensions of interest. Most frameworks that perform such multi-dimensional evaluation require training on large manually or synthetically generated datasets. In this paper, we study the efficacy of large language models as multi-dimensional evaluators using in-context learning, obviating the need for large training datasets. Our experiments show that in-context learning-based evaluators are competitive with learned evaluation frameworks for the task of text summarization, establishing state-of-the-art on dimensions such as relevance and factual consistency.

Our approach involves adapting the DNS 2020 models to the specific acoustic characteristics of VoIP communications, which includes distortion and artifacts caused by compression, transmission, and platform-specific processing. To this end, we propose a multi-task learning framework for VoIP-DNS that jointly optimizes noise suppression and VoIP-specific acoustics for speech enhancement. We evaluate our approach on a diverse VoIP scenarios and show that it outperforms both industry performance and state-of-the-art methods for speech enhancement on VoIP applications. Our results demonstrate the potential of models trained on DNS-2020 to be improved and tailored to different VoIP platforms using VoIP-DNS, whose findings have important applications in areas such as speech recognition, voice assistants, and telecommunication.\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms' published?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms'?\\nAnswer: 11\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms' have?\\nAnswer: 2\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms'?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09048\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science, Engineering\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms'?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, volume: abs/2303.09048; ArXiv\\nNotes: ##Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/7333be530df311b3148e9857ce9f481975cf0a9b.csv', 'row': 18}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Who are the authors of the paper 'Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms'?\\nAnswer: Joseph Konan, Ojas Bhargave, Shikhar Agnihotri, Hojeong Lee, Ankit Shah, Shuo Han, YUNYANG ZENG, Amanda Shu, Haohui Liu, Xuankai Chang, Hamza Khalid, Minseon Gwak, Kawon Lee, Minjeong Kim, B.

Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge'?\\nAnswer: In this work we detail our submission to the Clarity ICASSP 2023 grand challenge, in which participants have to develop a strong target speech enhancement system for hearing-aid (HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments. Our system builds on our previous submission at the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2): iNeuBe-X, which consists in an iterative neural/conventional beamforming enhancement pipeline, guided by an enrollment utterance from the target speaker. This model, which won by a large margin the CEC2, is an extension of the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model for multi-channel, streamable target-speaker speech enhancement. Here, this approach is extended and further improved by leveraging generative adversarial training, which we show proves especially useful when the training data is limited. Using only the official 6k training scenes data, our best model achieves 0.80 hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) and 0.41 hearing-aid speech quality index (HASQI) scores on the synthetic evaluation set. However, our model generalized poorly on the semi-real evaluation set. This highlights the fact that our community should focus more on real-world evaluation and less on fully synthetic datasets.\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In which venue was the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge' published?\\nAnswer: IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 9}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: In what year was the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge' published?\\nAnswer: 2023\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many references are in the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge'?\\nAnswer: 14\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many citations does the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 12}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the citation count of 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge' have?\\nAnswer: 1\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: How many influential citations does the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge' have?\\nAnswer: 0\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 14}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: Is the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge' open access?\\nAnswer: Yes\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 15}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the open access PDF URL of the paper titled 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge'?\\nAnswer: openAccessPdf not available\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 16}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the fields of study for the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge'?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nNotes: ##Title: Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge\", metadata={'source': '../data/papers_metadata_csv/ebb75ff5b5e55ba15e4239ed0ffa6ff2ad00b721.csv', 'row': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the journal name for the paper 'Multi-Channel Speaker Extraction with Adversarial Training: The Wavlab Submission to The Clarity ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge'?\\nAnswer: ICASSP 2023 -

Document(page_content=\"Question: What is the abstract of the paper 'MRI Features for Predicting Microvascular Invasion and Postoperative Recurrence in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Without Peritumoral Hypointensity'?\\nAnswer: Purpose To identify MRI features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and postoperative intrahepatic recurrence in patients without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity. Patients and Methods One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making. Results Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071–8.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule (P=0.038). Satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI: 1.733–6.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Conclusion In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS.\\nNotes:

the abstract of the paper 'Structure-Aware Language Model Pretraining Improves Dense Retrieval on Structured Data'?\\nAnswer: This paper presents Structure Aware Dense Retrieval (SANTA) model, which encodes user queries and structured data in one universal embedding space for retrieving structured data. SANTA proposes two pretraining methods to make language models structure-aware and learn effective representations for structured data: 1) Structured Data Alignment, which utilizes the natural alignment relations between structured data and unstructured data for structure-aware pretraining. It contrastively trains language models to represent multi-modal text data and teaches models to distinguish matched structured data for unstructured texts. 2) Masked Entity Prediction, which designs an entity-oriented mask strategy and asks language models to fill in the masked entities. Our experiments show that SANTA achieves state-of-the-art on code search and product search and conducts convincing results in the zero-shot setting. SANTA learns tailored representations for multi-modal text data by aligning structured and unstructured data pairs and capturing structural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the structured data.

SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/A.

We show that the proposed simultaneous policy can be applied to both streaming blockwise models and offline encoder-decoder models.

The diversity of human speech, however, often goes beyond the coverage of these corpora. We believe the ability to handle such diversity is crucial for AI systems to achieve human-level communication. Our work explores the use of more abundant real-world data for building speech synthesizers. We train TTS systems using real-world speech from YouTube and podcasts. We observe the mismatch between training and inference alignments in mel-spectrogram based autoregressive models, leading to unintelligible synthesis, and demonstrate that learned discrete codes within multiple code groups effectively resolves this issue. We introduce our MQTTS system whose architecture is designed for multiple code generation and monotonic alignment, along with the use of a clean silence prompt to improve synthesis quality. We conduct ablation analyses to identify the efficacy of our methods.

In this paper, we first revisit the popular pseudo-labeling methods via a unified sample weighting formulation and demonstrate the inherent quantity-quality trade-off problem of pseudo-labeling with thresholding, which may prohibit learning. To this end, we propose SoftMatch to overcome the trade-off by maintaining both high quantity and high quality of pseudo-labels during training, effectively exploiting the unlabeled data. We derive a truncated Gaussian function to weight samples based on their confidence, which can be viewed as a soft version of the confidence threshold. We further enhance the utilization of weakly-learned classes by proposing a uniform alignment approach. In experiments, SoftMatch shows substantial improvements across a wide variety of benchmarks, including image, text, and imbalanced classification.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/B.

While efforts have been made to engage youth in understanding AI through developing machine learning models, few provided in-depth insights into the nuanced learning processes. In this study, we examined high school students’ data modeling practices and processes. Twenty-eight students developed machine learning models with text data for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. We identified nine data modeling practices that describe students’ processes of model exploration, development, and testing and two themes about evaluating automated decisions from data technologies. The results provide implications for designing accessible data modeling experiences for students to understand data justice as well as the role and responsibility of data modelers in creating AI technologies.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/C.

Prior works on retrieval augmentation usually jointly fine-tune the retriever and the LM, making them closely coupled. In this paper, we explore the scheme of generic retrieval plug-in: the retriever is to assist target LMs that may not be known beforehand or are unable to be fine-tuned together. To retrieve useful documents for unseen target LMs, we propose augmentation-adapted retriever (AAR), which learns LM’s preferences obtained from a known source LM. Experiments on the MMLU and PopQA datasets demonstrate that our AAR trained with a small source LM is able to significantly improve the zero-shot generalization of larger target LMs ranging from 250M Flan-T5 to 175B InstructGPT. Further analysis indicates that the preferences of different LMs overlap, enabling AAR trained with a single source LM to serve as a generic plug-in for various target LMs. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/OpenMatch/Augmentation-Adapted-Retriever.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Chenyan Xiong_2139787803.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 180}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: 47070750\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 181}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"Question: What are the papers written by Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: Pragmatic Inference with a CLIP Listener for Contrastive Captioning, SantaCoder: don't reach for the stars!, Grounding Language Models to Images for Multimodal Generation, StarCoder: may the source be with you!, Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models, WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: \", metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 182}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the H-index of Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: 26\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 183}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author citation count of Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: 2668\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 184}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author paper count of Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: 50\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 185}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What journals has Daniel Fried published in?\\nAnswer: ArXiv\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 186}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the journals and how many papers has Daniel Fried published in each?\\nAnswer: No journal data available.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 187}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the fields of study of Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 188}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: How many papers has Daniel Fried published in open access journals?\\nAnswer: 6\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 189}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What venues has Daniel Fried published in?\\nAnswer: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, arXiv.org\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 190}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the most cited paper from Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: StarCoder: may the source be with you!\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 191}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the url of the most cited paper from Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06161\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Daniel Fried_47070750.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 192}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: Who are the authors of the most cited paper from Daniel Fried?\\nAnswer: Raymond Li, Loubna Ben Allal, Yangtian Zi, Niklas Muennighoff, Denis Kocetkov, Chenghao Mou, Marc Marone, Christopher Akiki, Jia Li, Jenny Chim, Qian Liu, Evgenii Zheltonozhskii, Terry Yue Zhuo, Thomas Wang, Olivier Dehaene, Mishig Davaadorj, J.

The API vendors charge their users based on usage, more specifically on the number of ``tokens'' processed or generated by the underlying language models. What constitutes a token, however, is training data and model dependent with a large variance in the number of tokens required to convey the same information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non-uniformity on the fairness of an API's pricing policy across languages. We conduct a systematic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI's language model API on multilingual benchmarks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large number of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speakers tend to also come from regions where the APIs are less affordable to begin with. Through these analyses, we aim to increase transparency around language model APIs' pricing policies and encourage the vendors to make them more equitable.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/David R.

Xing?\\nAnswer: Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain.

Yet, progress on model efficiency has been impeded by practical challenges in model evaluation and comparison. For example, hardware is challenging to control due to disparate levels of accessibility across different institutions. Moreover, improvements in metrics such as FLOPs often fail to translate to progress in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Pentathlon, a benchmark for holistic and realistic evaluation of model efficiency. Pentathlon focuses on inference, which accounts for a majority of the compute in a model's lifecycle. It offers a strictly-controlled hardware platform, and is designed to mirror real-world applications scenarios. It incorporates a suite of metrics that target different aspects of efficiency, including latency, throughput, memory overhead, and energy consumption. Pentathlon also comes with a software library that can be seamlessly integrated into any codebase and enable evaluation. As a standardized and centralized evaluation platform, Pentathlon can drastically reduce the workload to make fair and reproducible efficiency comparisons. While initially focused on natural language processing (NLP) models, Pentathlon is designed to allow flexible extension to other fields. We envision Pentathlon will stimulate algorithmic innovations in building efficient models, and foster an increased awareness of the social and environmental implications in the development of future-generation NLP models.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Emma Strubell_2268272.json\\nNotes: \", metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 255}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: 144287919\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 256}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the papers written by Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: GameQA: Gamified Mobile App Platform for Building Multiple-Domain Question-Answering Datasets, InPars-Light: Cost-Effective Unsupervised Training of Efficient Rankers, Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA, Chain-of-Skills: A Configurable Model for Open-Domain Question Answering\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 257}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the H-index of Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: 38\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 258}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author citation count of Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: 6031\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 259}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author paper count of Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: 216\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 260}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What journals has Eric Nyberg published in?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, Proceedings of the Third DialDoc Workshop on Document-grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 261}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the journals and how many papers has Eric Nyberg published in each?\\nAnswer: 1 in ArXiv, 1 in Proceedings of the Third DialDoc Workshop on Document-grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 262}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the fields of study of Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 263}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: How many papers has Eric Nyberg published in open access journals?\\nAnswer: 4\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 264}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What venues has Eric Nyberg published in?\\nAnswer: Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, arXiv.org, Workshop on Document-grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering, Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 265}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the most cited paper from Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: InPars-Light: Cost-Effective Unsupervised Training of Efficient Rankers\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 266}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the url of the most cited paper from Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.02998\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Eric Nyberg_144287919.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 267}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: Who are the authors of the most cited paper from Eric Nyberg?\\nAnswer: Leonid Boytsov, Preksha Patel, Vivek Sourabh, Riddhi Nisar, Sayan Kundu, R.

As a by-product, we developed InPars-light, which is a simple-yet-effective modification of InPars. Unlike InPars, InPars-light uses 7x-100x smaller ranking models and only a freely available language model BLOOM, which -- as we found out -- produced more accurate rankers compared to a proprietary GPT-3 model. On all five English retrieval collections (used in the original InPars study) we obtained substantial (7%-30%) and statistically significant improvements over BM25 (in nDCG and MRR) using only a 30M parameter six-layer MiniLM-30M ranker and a single three-shot prompt. In contrast, in the InPars study only a 100x larger monoT5-3B model consistently outperformed BM25, whereas their smaller monoT5-220M model (which is still 7x larger than our MiniLM ranker) outperformed BM25 only on MS MARCO and TREC DL 2020. In the same three-shot prompting scenario, our 435M parameter DeBERTA v3 ranker was at par with the 7x larger monoT5-3B (average gain over BM25 of 1.3 vs 1.32): In fact, on three out of five datasets, DeBERTA slightly outperformed monoT5-3B. Finally, these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used by Bonifacio et al. (2022). We believe that InPars-light is the first truly cost-effective prompt-based unsupervised recipe to train and deploy neural ranking models that outperform BM25.

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Graham Neubig_1700325.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 300}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: 144987107\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 301}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the papers written by Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: Conversational Search with Random Walks over Entity Graphs, KALE: Using a K-Sparse Projector for Lexical Expansion, CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms, Active Retrieval Augmented Generation, Multi-Objective Improvement of Android Applications\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 302}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the H-index of Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: 75\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 303}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author citation count of Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: 19329\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 304}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author paper count of Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: 331\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 305}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What journals has Jamie Callan published in?\\nAnswer: Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGIR International Conference on Theory of Information Retrieval, ArXiv\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 306}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the journals and how many papers has Jamie Callan published in each?\\nAnswer: 3 in Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGIR International Conference on Theory of Information Retrieval, 2 in ArXiv\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 307}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the fields of study of Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 308}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: How many papers has Jamie Callan published in open access journals?\\nAnswer: 5\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 309}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What venues has Jamie Callan published in?\\nAnswer: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval, Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, arXiv.org\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 310}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the most cited paper from Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: Active Retrieval Augmented Generation\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 311}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the url of the most cited paper from Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06983\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Jamie Callan_144987107.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 312}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: Who are the authors of the most cited paper from Jamie Callan?\\nAnswer: Zhengbao Jiang, Frank F.

Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the advantages and challenges of LLMs for MMT by answering two questions: 1) How well do LLMs perform in translating massive languages? 2) Which factors affect LLMs' performance in translation? We thoroughly evaluate eight popular LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our empirical results show that translation capabilities of LLMs are continually improving. GPT-4 has beat the strong supervised baseline NLLB in 40.91% of translation directions but still faces a large gap towards the commercial translation system, especially on low-resource languages. Through further analysis, we discover that LLMs exhibit new working patterns when used for MMT. First, instruction semantics can surprisingly be ignored when given in-context exemplars. Second, cross-lingual exemplars can provide better task guidance for low-resource translation than exemplars in the same language pairs. Third, LLM can acquire translation ability in a resource-efficient way and generate moderate translation even on zero-resource languages.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lei Li_143900005.json\\nNotes: \", metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 360}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Lori S Levin?\\nAnswer: 1686960\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lori S.

Despite these empirical advances, there remain fundamental research questions: how can we quantify the nature of interactions that exist among input features? Subsequently, how can we capture these interactions using suitable data-driven methods? To answer this question, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree of redundancy , uniqueness , and synergy across input features, which we term the PID statistics of a multimodal distribution. Using 2 newly proposed estimators that scale to high-dimensional distributions, we demonstrate their usefulness in quantifying the interactions within multimodal datasets, the nature of interactions captured by multimodal models, and principled approaches for model selection. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets where the PID statistics are known and on large-scale multimodal benchmarks where PID estimation was previously impossible. Finally, to demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach, we present three case studies in pathology, mood prediction, and robotic perception where our framework accurately recommends strong multimodal models for each application.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Louis-Philippe Morency_49933077.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 390}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: 39978626\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 391}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the papers written by Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: Muse: Text-To-Image Generation via Masked Generative Transformers, SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs, StyleDrop: Text-to-Image Generation in Any Style, Learning Disentangled Prompts for Compositional Image Synthesis, Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation, VideoGLUE: Video General Understanding Evaluation of Foundation Models\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 392}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the H-index of Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: 41\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 393}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author citation count of Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: 7875\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 394}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author paper count of Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: 79\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 395}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What journals has Lu Jiang published in?\\nAnswer: ArXiv\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 396}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the journals and how many papers has Lu Jiang published in each?\\nAnswer: No journal data available.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 397}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the fields of study of Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 398}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: How many papers has Lu Jiang published in open access journals?\\nAnswer: 6\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 399}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What venues has Lu Jiang published in?\\nAnswer: International Conference on Machine Learning, arXiv.org\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 400}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the most cited paper from Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: Muse: Text-To-Image Generation via Masked Generative Transformers\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 401}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the url of the most cited paper from Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00704\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Lu Jiang_39978626.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 402}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: Who are the authors of the most cited paper from Lu Jiang?\\nAnswer: Huiwen Chang, Han Zhang, Jarred Barber, AJ Maschinot, Jose Lezama, Lu Jiang, Ming Yang, K.

Muse is trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space: given the text embedding extracted from a pre-trained large language model (LLM), Muse is trained to predict randomly masked image tokens. Compared to pixel-space diffusion models, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse is significantly more efficient due to the use of discrete tokens and requiring fewer sampling iterations; compared to autoregressive models, such as Parti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of parallel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM enables fine-grained language understanding, translating to high-fidelity image generation and the understanding of visual concepts such as objects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinality etc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a new SOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06. The Muse 3B parameter model achieves an FID of 7.88 on zero-shot COCO evaluation, along with a CLIP score of 0.32. Muse also directly enables a number of image editing applications without the need to fine-tune or invert the model: inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing.

The involvement of patient intrinsic factors was indicated, but the mechanism is largely unknown. Methods Ohia mice with HLHS causing mutations in chromatin modifier Sin3A-associated protein 130 (Sap130) and cell adhesion protein ProtocadherinA9 (Pcdha9) were investigated for brain abnormalities by histology, immunomicroscopy, and molecular profiling by RNAseq, Sap130 ChIPseq, and genome-wide methylome analysis. Additionally, adult viable Pcdha9m/m and Emx1-cre:Sap130f/− mice with forebrain deletion of Sap130 were examined by brain MRI and behavioral assessments. Results Ohia mice have brain abnormalities comprising forebrain hypoplasia and microcephaly in conjunction with a cortical neurogenesis defect. This is associated with loss of intermediate progenitors due to mitotic arrest and apoptosis from multipolar spindle formation, a mechanism also observed in primary microcephaly. Brain RNAseq showed perturbation of REST transcriptional regulation of neurogenesis, disruption of CREB signaling regulating synaptic plasticity and memory, and defects in neurovascular coupling indicating perturbation of brain-sparing cerebral autoregulation. Disease pathways recovered included autism, intellectual disability, and other neurobehavioral/neurological deficits. These same pathways were observed upon intersection of genes that are differentially expressed with those that are differentially methylated and also are ChIPseq targets of Sap130, suggesting the transcriptional changes are epigenetically regulated. Adult viable mice harboring either the Pcdha9 mutation or forebrain-specific Sap130 deletion showed similar learning/memory deficits and autism-like behavior, suggesting they act on convergent pathways. Conclusions Our observations indicate the intrinsic factors contributing to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcome associated with HLHS involve spindle defects causing impaired corticoneurogenesis, and brain and behavioral deficits associated with perturbed epigenetic regulation of neurodevelopmental pathways. Novelty and Significance What is known? Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a severe congenital heart disease, is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome attributable to patient intrinsic factors. Cortical neurogenesis defect with reduced brain volume and microcephaly are observed beginning in utero, suggesting a developmental etiology. Learning impairment and autism spectrum disorder are commonly observed in HLHS. What new information does this article contribute? The Ohia HLHS mouse model exhibits neurodevelopmental deficits comprising microcephaly and cortical neurogenesis defects with loss of neural progenitors from multipolar spindle formation, as well as impaired neurovascular coupling. Molecular profiling showed disturbance of REST, transcriptional regulator of neural stem cells, and CREB signaling regulating synaptic plasticity, with neurobehavioral assessments of the mutant mice showing learning/memory and autism-like behavioral deficits. Intersection of transcriptome and DNA methylation analyses uncovered an epigenetic basis for the neurodevelopmental/neurobehavioral abnormalities, Analysis of an HLHS mouse model indicated patient intrinsic factors causing adverse neurodevelopment in HLHS are genetic and epigenetic in etiology. This may include a mitotic spindle defect that would not be rescued by in utero aortic valvuloplasty, and a defect in neurovascular coupling that is likely to reduce the efficacy of maternal hyperoxygenation. However, epigenetic therapy may provide a new avenue for treatment that should be explored.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/M.

This shared task is concerned with automatic translation between signed and spoken languages. The task is unusual in the sense that it requires processing visual information (such as video frames or human pose estimation) beyond the well-known paradigm of text-to-text machine translation (MT). The task offers four tracks involving the following languages: Swiss German Sign Language (DSGS), French Sign Language of Switzerland (LSF-CH), Italian Sign Language of Switzerland (LIS-CH), German, French and Italian. Four teams (including one working on a baseline submission) participated in this second edition of the task, all submitting to the DSGS-to-German track. Besides a system ranking and system papers describing state-of-the-art techniques, this shared task makes the following scientific contributions: novel corpora and reproducible baseline systems.

In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. We demonstrate that Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART and Longformer by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code.

It also provides an opportunity to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to zero-shot settings when asked to classify the case outcome with respect to articles not seen during training. We devise zero-shot experiments and apply domain adaptation methods based on domain discrimination and Wasserstein distance.

While the field of CausalNLP has attracted much interest in the recent years, existing causal inference datasets in NLP primarily rely on discovering causality from empirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose the first benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we formulate a novel task Corr2Cause, which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causal relationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of more than 200K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing LLMs. Through our experiments, we identify a key shortcoming of LLMs in terms of their causal inference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to random performance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try to re-purpose LLMs for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these models still fail to generalize -- they can only perform causal inference in in-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used in the queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail in out-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. Corr2Cause is a challenging task for LLMs, and would be helpful in guiding future research on improving LLMs' pure reasoning skills and generalizability.

We analyze a crowd-sourced corpus of privacy questions collected from mobile app users to determine to what extent these mobile app labels actually address users’ privacy concerns and questions. While there are differences between iOS labels and Google Play labels, our results indicate that an important percentage of people’s privacy questions are not answered or only partially addressed in today’s labels.

These approaches have led to the development of versatile models capable of tackling a wide array of tasks, while delivering state-of-the-art performance. However, current models inherently lack the capacity to produce the requisite language for open-ended tasks, such as Audio Captioning or Audio Question&Answering. We introduce Pengi, a novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording, and text, and generates free-form text as output. The input audio is represented as a sequence of continuous embeddings by an audio encoder. A text encoder does the same for the corresponding text input. Both sequences are combined as a prefix to prompt a pre-trained frozen language model.

A real-time, computer-generated list of the most important, outlying data points from thousands of public health data streams could assist an expert reviewer in identifying these irregularities. However, existing outlier detection frameworks perform poorly on this task because they do not account for the data volume or for the statistical properties of public health streams. Accordingly, we developed FlaSH (Flagging Streams in public Health), a practical outlier detection framework for public health data users that uses simple, scalable models to capture these statistical properties explicitly. In an experiment where human experts evaluate FlaSH and existing methods (including deep learning approaches), FlaSH scales to the data volume of this task, matches or exceeds these other methods in mean accuracy, and identifies the outlier points that users empirically rate as more helpful. Based on these results, FlaSH has been deployed on data streams used by public health stakeholders.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Roni Rosenfeld_88507334.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 570}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Scott Fahlman?\\nAnswer: 1758714\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/S.

Scone is a knowledge base system designed for storing and manipulating rich representations of general knowledge in symbolic form. It represents knowledge in the form of nodes and links in a network structure, and it can perform basic inference about the relationships between different elements efficiently. On its own, Scone acts as a sort of\"smart memory\"that can interface with other software systems. One area of improvement for Scone is how useful it can be in supplying knowledge to an intelligent agent that can use the knowledge to perform actions and update the knowledge base with its observations. We augment the Scone system with a production rule engine that automatically performs simple inference based on existing and newly-added structures in Scone\\'s knowledge base, potentially improving the capabilities of any planning systems built on top of Scone. Production rule systems consist of\"if-then\"production rules that try to match their predicates to existing knowledge and fire their actions when their predicates are satisfied. We propose two kinds of production rules, if-added and if-needed rules, that differ in how they are checked and fired to cover multiple use cases. We then implement methods to efficiently check and fire these rules in a large knowledge base. The new rule engine is not meant to be a complex stand-alone planner, so we discuss how it fits into the context of Scone and future work on planning systems.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/S.

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance. Our work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 can be further improved at test time using our simple, standalone approach.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/S.

In this work, we propose a multi-modal AI system named AudioGPT, which complements LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) with 1) foundation models to process complex audio information and solve numerous understanding and generation tasks; and 2) the input/output interface (ASR, TTS) to support spoken dialogue. With an increasing demand to evaluate multi-modal LLMs of human intention understanding and cooperation with foundation models, we outline the principles and processes and test AudioGPT in terms of consistency, capability, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of AudioGPT in solving AI tasks with speech, music, sound, and talking head understanding and generation in multi-round dialogues, which empower humans to create rich and diverse audio content with unprecedented ease.

Most existing attacks rely on the observation that models tend to assign higher probabilities to their training samples than non-training points. However, simple thresholding of the model score in isolation tends to lead to high false-positive rates as it does not account for the intrinsic complexity of a sample. Recent work has demonstrated that reference-based attacks which compare model scores to those obtained from a reference model trained on similar data can substantially improve the performance of MIAs. However, in order to train reference models, attacks of this kind make the strong and arguably unrealistic assumption that an adversary has access to samples closely resembling the original training data. Therefore, we investigate their performance in more realistic scenarios and find that they are highly fragile in relation to the data distribution used to train reference models. To investigate whether this fragility provides a layer of safety, we propose and evaluate neighbourhood attacks, which compare model scores for a given sample to scores of synthetically generated neighbour texts and therefore eliminate the need for access to the training data distribution. We show that, in addition to being competitive with reference-based attacks that have perfect knowledge about the training data distribution, our attack clearly outperforms existing reference-free attacks as well as reference-based attacks with imperfect knowledge, which demonstrates the need for a reevaluation of the threat model of adversarial attacks.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick_1400419309.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 645}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: 40975594\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 646}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the papers written by Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals, Learning to Give Useful Hints: Assistance Action Evaluation and Policy Improvements, Genitourinary Management and Follow-Up for Patients with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 647}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the H-index of Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: 81\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 648}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author citation count of Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: 34877\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 649}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author paper count of Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: 353\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 650}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What journals has Tom Mitchell published in?\\nAnswer: ArXiv, Burns Open\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 651}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the journals and how many papers has Tom Mitchell published in each?\\nAnswer: 1 in ArXiv, 1 in Burns Open\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 652}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the fields of study of Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: Computer Science\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 653}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: How many papers has Tom Mitchell published in open access journals?\\nAnswer: 3\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 654}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What venues has Tom Mitchell published in?\\nAnswer: arXiv.org, European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, Burns Open\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 655}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the most cited paper from Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 656}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the url of the most cited paper from Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04449\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 657}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: Who are the authors of the most cited paper from Tom Mitchell?\\nAnswer: Yue Wu, Yewen Fan, P.

On the other hand, humans learn to perform tasks not only from interaction or demonstrations, but also by reading unstructured text documents, e.g., instruction manuals. Instruction manuals and wiki pages are among the most abundant data that could inform agents of valuable features and policies or task-specific environmental dynamics and reward structures. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ability to utilize human-written instruction manuals to assist learning policies for specific tasks should lead to a more efficient and better-performing agent. We propose the Read and Reward framework. Read and Reward speeds up RL algorithms on Atari games by reading manuals released by the Atari game developers. Our framework consists of a QA Extraction module that extracts and summarizes relevant information from the manual and a Reasoning module that evaluates object-agent interactions based on information from the manual. An auxiliary reward is then provided to a standard A2C RL agent, when interaction is detected. Experimentally, various RL algorithms obtain significant improvement in performance and training speed when assisted by our design.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Tom Michael Mitchell_40975594.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 660}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of William Cohen?\\nAnswer: 50056360\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/William W.

However, this process is expensive, since a new expert model must be learned for each subject. In this paper, we present SuTI, a Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that replaces subject-specific fine tuning with in-context learning. Given a few demonstrations of a new subject, SuTI can instantly generate novel renditions of the subject in different scenes, without any subject-specific optimization. SuTI is powered by apprenticeship learning, where a single apprentice model is learned from data generated by a massive number of subject-specific expert models. Specifically, we mine millions of image clusters from the Internet, each centered around a specific visual subject. We adopt these clusters to train a massive number of expert models, each specializing in a different subject. The apprentice model SuTI then learns to imitate the behavior of these fine-tuned experts. SuTI can generate high-quality and customized subject-specific images 20x faster than optimization-based SoTA methods. On the challenging DreamBench and DreamBench-v2, our human evaluation shows that SuTI significantly outperforms existing models like InstructPix2Pix, Textual Inversion, Imagic, Prompt2Prompt, Re-Imagen and DreamBooth, especially on the subject and text alignment aspects.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/William W.

To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines.

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance.

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yonatan Bisk_3312309.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 720}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author ID of Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: 145317727\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 721}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the papers written by Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: Understanding Ethics in NLP Authoring and Reviewing\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 722}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the H-index of Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: 33\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 723}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author citation count of Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: 4659\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 724}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the author paper count of Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: 92\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 725}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What journals has Yulia Tsvetkov published in?\\nAnswer: Proceedings of the 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Tutorial Abstracts\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 726}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the journals and how many papers has Yulia Tsvetkov published in each?\\nAnswer: No journal data available.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 727}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What are the fields of study of Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: \\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 728}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: How many papers has Yulia Tsvetkov published in open access journals?\\nAnswer: 1\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 729}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What venues has Yulia Tsvetkov published in?\\nAnswer: Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 730}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the most cited paper from Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: Understanding Ethics in NLP Authoring and Reviewing\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 731}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: What is the url of the most cited paper from Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-tutorials.4.pdf\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 732}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: Who are the authors of the most cited paper from Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: Luciana Benotti, Karen Fort, Min-Yen Kan, Yulia Tsvetkov\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 733}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: TLDR/Summary of the most cited paper from Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: This tutorial will equip participants with basic guidelines for thinking deeply about ethical issues and review common considerations that recur in NLP research.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_145317727.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 734}),\n"," Document(page_content='Question: Abstract of the most cited paper from Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: With NLP research now quickly being transferred into real-world applications, it is important to be aware of and think through the consequences of our scientific investigation.

from Yulia Tsvetkov?\\nAnswer: Language models (LMs) are pretrained on diverse data sources—news, discussion forums, books, online encyclopedias. A significant portion of this data includes facts and opinions which, on one hand, celebrate democracy and diversity of ideas, and on the other hand are inherently socially biased. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure media biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have political leanings which reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech predictions and media biases into misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.\\nDocument: ../data/paper_jsons/Yulia Tsvetkov_2073587169.json\\nNotes: ', metadata={'source': '../data/paper_logs/author.csv', 'row': 750})]"]},"execution_count":34,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["csv_args={\n","          \"delimiter\": \",\",\n","          \"quotechar\": '\"',\n","          'fieldnames': ['Question', 'Answer', 'Document', 'Notes']\n","      }\n","\n","# author_csv = []\n","# for file_path in csv_files:\n","author_csv = '../data/paper_logs/author.csv'\n","loader = CSVLoader(\n","    file_path=author_csv,\n","    csv_args=csv_args,\n",")\n","author_csv = loader.load()\n","author_csv"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":35,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17761,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710026046793,"user":{"displayName":"Vashisth Tiwari","userId":"14058204908965748495"},"user_tz":300},"id":"RWRt7B5ydNYq","outputId":"639b7d36-f249-452b-9433-d6791d793cc5"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (846 > 512).
